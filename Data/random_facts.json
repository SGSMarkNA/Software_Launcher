        "Ancient physicians also used pessaries, or vaginal suppositories, as abortifacients.\nThey were usually more potent than oral drugs and included substances like\nthe juice of the wild fig, a milky liquid which caused irritation,\nsoap-wort, myrrh, myrtle, lupine, cedar-oil mixed with water, wine, or hot\noil. Physicians also recommend smearing on the uterine opening goose fat,\nmashed leek and celery, rose oils, pine resin, copper scum, boiled honey,\nsodium carbonate, and even mouse dung.",
        "Some ancient pessaries were similar to Utus paste, a substance injected\ndirectly into the uterus as a method of abortion in Europe and the United\nStates until the 1960s, but eventually condemned as unsafe. Use of Utus paste\nto terminate pregnancy, however, can still be found in many developing countries.",
        "Ancient abortion methods included applying substances externally on the\nabdomen such as various ointments and creams, bruised corn boiled with vinegar,\nand boiled cypress leaves. Physicians, such as Galen, also recommended hot\nbaths, blood letting, strenuous physical exercise, leaping, riding in a shaky\ncarriage, carrying heavy weights, emotional shock, body massages with hot\noil, or being vigorously shaken by two strong men.",
        "Surgical abortion was well known in the ancient world though, due to lack\nof anesthetics and antibiotics, it was dangerous and painful. Celsus (c.\n25 B.C.-A.D. 50) provides the most complete account of a dilatation and curettage\n(D&C) operation, which required placing one, sometimes two hands, into\nthe uterus to straighten the fetus and then extracting the fetus with a hook.\nAncient texts such as Diseases of Women, Superfetation, and On\nthe excision of the foetus refer to a surgical tool called an embruosphaktes (embryo-slayer).",

        "Hippocrates alludes to abortion in his Hippocratic Oath. Some translators\nargue Hippocrates said he would not administer a woman a pessary to\nproduce an abortion. Other interpretations suggest that Hippocrates\nactually said he would not give a woman an abortive remedy. In\nthe landmark Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion, the United States\nSupreme Court in 1973 dismissed the oath as an incorrect application\nof a historical precedent.",
        "Physicians such as Pliny the Elder (A.D. 23-79), Dioscorides (c. 40-90),\nand Pseudo-Galen (129-216) mention more superstitious abortifacients,\nsuch as crossing over the root of a cyclamen, the egg of a crow, a viper,\nor a stone bitten by a dog. Additionally, if a woman crosses the menstrual\nblood of another woman, she will have an abortion.",
        "During the Middle Ages, abortion was tolerated because there were no laws\nagainst it. There were a variety of abortifacients, such as mixture known\nas a cup of roots and another called A Cure for All\nKinds of Stomach Aches. A medieval female physician, Dame Trotula\nof Salerno, may have been the first woman gynecologist and administered a\nnumber of remedies for the retention of menstrua, which was\nsometimes a code for early abortifacients.",
        "In Arabic society, the evidence of continuous uses of early abortifacients\nis abundant. When classical texts were reintroduced into the West via Arabic\ninfluence around the thirteenth century, Westerners had the knowledge of\nancient Greek and Roman medicine as well as the superior knowledge regarding\ncontraception and abortifacients from the Arabs.",
        "During the Renaissance, abortion was still tolerated, though Renaissance\nscholars knew less about birth control and abortifacients than did their\nmedieval, Islamic, and classical forerunners. Perhaps this is due to the\nmove of medicine from apprenticeship to male- and theory-centered universities,\nthe growing gap between physicians and midwives, and the desire for larger\nfamilies.",
        "The relative indifference of common law courts to a fetus changed in the\n1600s in England when abortion after a fetus had quickened became\nmanslaughter. However, any action before quickening that harmed\nthe pregnancy was not considered criminal under common law in England and\nthe United States.",

Because it was more profitable if the baby died, some baby farmers murdered the children. Two infamous British baby farmers were Margaret Waters (1835-1870) and Amelia Dyer (1837-1896). Together, these two women were responsible for at least 400 murders.",

        "In the 1930s, both new child labor laws in the 1930s and G. Stanley Halls theories of child psychology revolutionized child adoptions. Specifically, they helped shift adoption from a way to procure cheap labor to a way for a child to be placed into a loving family.",
        "The Colonial Orphan Asylum founded in 1836 was the first orphanage for black children and the predecessor of the Harlem-Dowling Childrens service agency in NYC, which still exists today.

It is an important turning point because it recognizes adoption as a social and legal process based on a childs welfare rather than on adult interest.\n\n\n1854\n\n\nCharles Loring Brace makes the Orphan Train movement national. He hopes to send urban orphans to kind Christian homes in the country. During the next 65 years, an estimated 150,000 street children are transferred to the Midwest, West, and South.\n\n\n1891\n\n\nMichigan becomes the first state to pass a law requiring the investigation of adoptive parents.\n\n\n1917\n\n\nThe first laws requiring the sealing of adoption records are passed in Minnesota.\n\n\n1929\n\n\nAfter 75 years, the Orphan Train movement ends.\n\n\n1933\n\n\nEdna Gladney successfully lobbies to have references to illegitimacy removed from birth certificates in Texas.\n\n\n1960\n\n\nPharmaceutical company G.D. Searle is approved to sell the first birth control pill, which dramatically affects the number of babies available for adoption.\n\n\n1961\n\n\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act incorporates provisions for orphans adopted from foreign countries by American citizens.\n\n\n1968\n\n\nNew York becomes the first state to provide an assistance program for children waiting to be adopted.\n\n\n1971\n\n\nThe Adoptees Liberty Movement Association is founded to help adoptees and birth parents find each other. The Adoption Listing Service in Illinois becomes the first agency to use photo listings to promote adoption of older children.\n\n\n1972\n\n\nThe National Association of Black Social Workers issues a public resolution opposing transracial adoption.\n\n\n1973\n\n\nRoe v. Wade legalizes abortion.\n\n\n1976\n\n\nSocial workers Annette Baran and Reuben Pannor advocate for open adoption, where birth parents and adoptive parents meet each other.\n\n\n1978\n\n\nThe Indian Child Welfare Act is passed, which mandates that a childs nation or the Bureau of Indian Affairs must be notified before a Native American child is placed for adoption.\n\n\n1980\n\n\nThe National Council for Adoption is formed to promote high standards in adoption procedures and provide information on adoption.\n\n\n1981\n\n\nRev. George M. Clements in Chicago founds the One Church, One Child movement to recruit black adoptive parents for black children through churches.\n\n\n1993\n\n\nThe Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption is passed. It sets uniform standards for the protection of adopted children.\n\n"

Rich housewives had wet nurses to look after their children; however, poor housewives not only had to look after children but also had to do day-to-day work both in the home and on the land. Many women from poor families did not live past the age of 40.",

They would have their husbands meal ready, but it would be doubtful they would have time to wash their hair. Additionally, many housewives were also now juggling jobs of their own.",

Since the technology was new, kitchens and households were redesigned to accommodate them. What had traditionally been the womans sphere suddenly became foreign. An army of experts began to take over her domestic work.",
        "With the advent of new technology, many companies told women to make their household tasks as automatic and brainless as possible. One unforeseen consequence was that housework continued to fill womens time while it starved their brains. Work that was traditionally passed from woman to woman was obsolete. Instead, women were taught by experts on how to cook, raise kids, and run their households.",

She proposed community kitchens, where all families in a community could eat together, communally rear a child, and provide outside services such as laundry for the family. She said professionals, not amateurs, should do housework.",

They boiled the toweling and cloth diapers (which were at least 10 per baby per day). They could not take out loans or mortgages or hire purchase agreements.

        "Jesus is an important figure in the Quran. Like Christians, Muslims believe in the virginal conception of Jesus by Gods spirit; however Muslims do not believe Jesus is the Son of God. He is one in the long line of righteous prophets and second only to Muhammad in importance. For Muslims, the concept of the Trinity represents a form of polytheism.",
        "Muslims do not believe in the concept of original sin, so there is no theological need for the all-atoning sacrifice of Jesus through his crucifixion and resurrection. Muslims believe we will be held accountable before God for our own actions and responsible for our own salvation.

        "Although there are no denominations in Islam like those that exist in Christianity (Roman Catholic, Methodist, Episcopalian, Lutheran, etc.), like all faiths, Islam has developed divisions, sects, and schools of thought.",
        "After the death of Muhammad, Islam split into two major branches, Sunnis (85% of all Muslims) and Shiites (15%). There is also a small, radical branch called the Kharijites. The split occurred due to disagreements about who should be the successor to the Prophet Muhammad.",

        "The Islamic year is 11 days shorter than the year used in the Western world. This is because the Western year is based on the orbit of the Earth around the Sun instead of on the phases of the moon.",
        "The Quran emphasizes modesty, although there is no specific prescription. Veiling women did not become widespread in the Islamic empire until three or four generations after Muhammads death. It was originally a status symbolnot to separate women from men but from the lower classes.",
        "While some blame Islam for the oppression of women, others see it as a means to reform. The status of women in Muslim countries differs as much as the countries themselves. Restrictions often originate not from Islam, but rather from cultural customs sometimes wrongly justified under Islam.",
        "As in Judaism, circumcision for males is required in Islam according to both tradition and Muhammads example. Symbolically, circumcision represents the religious process of submission to Gods will and commands, and the submission of base passions to the higher spiritual requirements of Islam.",
        "Muslim men are allowed to marry Christian or Jewish women because these women are People of the Book, or those who have divine revelation. However, Muslim women must marry a Muslim or someone who converts to Islam.",

        "Both alcohol and pork are forbidden in Islam.",
        "Jihad (to strive or struggle) is sometimes referred to as the sixth pillar of Islam, though it has no official status. Its meaning is controversial, but most scholars agree it means both 1) the inner struggle that one endures in trying to submit their will to the will of God, which is the greater jihad, and 2) the physical struggle against persecution and oppression, which is the lesser jihad. Some scholars suggest a third meaning, which is the struggle to build a good society.",
        "The translation of jihad as holy war is incorrect. In Arabic, the phrase would be harbun muqaddasa tur, a phrase that is not found in the Quran or in any other form of Islamic literature.",
        "Islam and Islamic law have consistently condemned terrorism.",
        "In Islam, as in Judaism, marriage between first cousins is quite common.",
        "In Islam, homosexuality is considered abnormal. In some areas, it is treated as a crime punishable under Islamic law; in others, homosexuality is tolerated but homosexuals are still set apart socially. Today, some gay Muslims have pressed for recognition of their rights in their communities.",
        "Muslim scholars agree that after the ensoulment (infusion of the soul) of the fetus (thought by some to occur at fertilization and by others at 120 days), abortion constitutes homicide and should be punished. Abortions are generally approved when the health of the mother is at stake.",
        "While the Quran does not address birth control, a few hadith (traditions) mention coitus interruptus. However, the majority of ulama (Muslim legal scholars) in the 21st century believe that temporary birth control is permissible as long as both husband and wife agree.",

        "While Christians cite the New Testament injunction to render unto Caesar what belongs to Caesar and to God what belongs to God (separation of church and state), Muslims believe that their primary act of faith is to strive to implement Gods will in both their private and their public life. Through history, Muslims have believed in an Islamic state government by Islamic law.",
        "Jerusalem is a revered city by all three of the great monotheistic faiths. For Muslims, Jerusalem was the original qibla (location that all Muslims face when they pray) and Mohammads destination in his Night Journey from Mecca.",
        "The absence of democracy in the Muslim world today has led many people to ask if there is something about the Muslim culture that is antithetical to democracy. The answer to this question lies more in history and politics than in religion.",
        "When it is time to pray, a man called a muezzin calls out from a minaret, which is a tower on or near the mosque. Sometimes his call to prayer is played through a loud speaker. He will turn to the four compass directions (north, south, east, and west) and at each turn will declare the Shahada, or Islamic creed: God is most great. There is no God but Allah. Muhammad is the prophet of God.",

        "The Greeks and Romans regulated nutrition on the theory of the four humors\ncirculating throughout the body (warm, cold, moist, dry). Classical physicians\ntried to correct an excess of cold and moist humors by providing\nhot, dry foods and vice versa. For example, a womans body was seen as\nwetter and colder than a mans and, therefore, she was to avoid food\nthat would make her even colder and wetter, such as fish, eels, and meat from\nnewborn animals.",
        "Many parents during the Roman empire who were influenced by doctors such\nas Soranus and Galen often denied their babies colostrum (protein-rich breast\nmilk) believing it was too thick and not good for the childs digestion.\nThey regularly gave their babies to a wet-nurse (though the mothers\nmilk was usually the best) and were likely to wean their babies onto foods\nthat lacked adequate nutrition, such as diluted cereals and mixtures of honey\nor wine with softened bread.",

        "There is considerable debate as to why 911 was chosen as an emergency number. It was probably based on several factors, including the precedent of Britain using a three-digit emergency number, the ease of dialing two ones on a rotary dial phone, and the technology at the time.",
        "The number 911 was developed by AT&T as a public service to improve emergency communications. There is some speculation that AT&T was motivated to create 911 in order to divert millions of emergency telephone calls (and reduce costs) that were made to its 0 operators.",

        "In most areas, households and businesses pay a small monthly fee for 911 service on their phone bill. There is no charge for calling 911, though any EMS or ambulances dispatched through 911 may charge for taking someone to the hospital. That is a separate charge, not a 911 charge.",
        "A person should not call 911 for any of the following: 1) for information, 2) for directory assistance, 3) just to talk, 4) paying for traffic tickets, 5) for a pet emergency, or 6) as a prank.",
        "If someone calls 911 by mistake, he or she should not hang up. Rather they should let the dispatcher know what happened so they know there really isnt an emergency.",
        "A woman in Deltona, Florida, was arrested after she called 911 four times to complain about a nail technician. Even with a police deputy sitting next to her, she still called 911 to complain that her nails were too short.",
        "Texting 911 is not available in most areas, though the 911 industry is working with wireless carriers and the FCC to make texting 911 widespread. If texting 911 is available in a persons area, remember the phrase Call when you can, text when you cant, which means texting should be used only when a voice call is impossible.",
        "Enhanced 911, or E 911, is a system that routes an emergency call to the appropriate 911 answering point, or PSAP, for the callers location AND automatically displays the callers phone number and address. In most cases, the phone number and location information is available from cell phones.",
        "Senator John McCains brother, Joe McCain, allegedly called 911 wanting to know why traffic was backed up on his side of the street and not the other side and then hung up. After the 911 dispatcher called and left a message on his machine indicating that abusing 911 could be a criminal matter, McCain called back and complained about the message. The officer replied: 911 is for emergencies only, not just because youre sitting in traffic.",
        "A 58-year-old Florida woman was accused of using 911 twice to solicit sex. When an officer initially arrived, she said there was no emergency and instead grabbed the officers arm and rubbed his chest. Police left her with a warning, but when she later made another call, she was promptly arrested.",
        "Swatting, or calling 911 to get the SWAT team to someones house for a bogus crime, is dangerous and can get the prank caller arrested.",
        "A man called 911 to complain that he was stuck in a hot tub. He requested some hot chocolate, marshmallows, and a hug.",
        "In 2012, Joshua Basso of Dover, Florida, allegedly dialed 911 repeatedly and requested female officers to come to his house to have sex with him. That same year, Clyde Hobbs called 911 in Oklahoma at least 17 times in one day in order to talk dirty to female officers.",
        "In 2012, Orlando police released 911 transcripts of calls made by an angry restaurant manager who found two patrons having sex on an outside table in front of horrified parents and children. Ultimately, the couple avoided arrest because none of the parents wanted to make a statement.",
        "Technically it isnt possible to hack into the national 911 network sincere there is no national 911 network. All networks are local networks. While it is possible to disable a local network, no one has ever gotten into the computers at a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP)."

        "A landmark study in 1966 by the University of MinnesotaMinneapolis gathered a group of 664 student volunteers. The study showed that there was little or no difference between introverted and extroverted personalities when it came to being liked by a date. In other words, young college adults were primarily concerned about the physical attractiveness of their date.",

        "Researchers note that women are more likely to limit sexual intercourse to relationships involving affection and the possibility of marriage. Women also place more emphasis than men do on their possible partners socioeconomic status. Therefore, status along with the willingness and ability to invest affection and resources in a relationship often outweighs the effects of physical attraction in a womans selection of a mate.",
        "Researchers have found that many women, despite expressed preferences, actually want nice guys as friends or long-term boyfriends, but preferred bad boys who were more physically attractive and willing to manipulate women into sexual activities as sexual partners.",
        "Studies note that sometimes those who have a high level of physical attractiveness seek less attractive mates in order to wield more power over them. In other words, less attractive people may attract more attractive mates because they are more likely to yield to their whims.",
        "In 1939, men ranked physical attractiveness 14th on a list of 18 desirable mate characteristics, but 8th in 1996. For the same period, womens value of a prospective husbands physical attractiveness jumped from 17th place to 13th. Analysts point to the increase in visual media, TV, movies, the Internet, and virtual reality as a likely cause of the shift. There was a concomitant decrease in the value of refinement, neatness, and chastity for both men and women.",
        "Chastity as a value factor in mate selection ranked 10th for men in 1939, but 16th in 1996. For women, it ranked 10th in 1939 and was next to last, 17th, in 1996. Researchers note the increased dissemination of birth control devices and the sexual revolution of the 1960s as a major influence of the shift.",

        "Studies show that a babys attractiveness rises with age from birth, peaks around the age of 9-11 months, and then declines again. Researchers speculate that babies close to their first birthdays are cuter because they need more attention as they are becoming more mobile and more prone to accidents. Babies that are assessed as cute have large eyes, small noses and mouths, and a large forehead.",

        "Many philosophers hold that the brain is a detector of the mind and that the mind is an inner, subjective state of consciousness.",
        "Philosophers have used a variety of metaphors to describe the mind, including a blank sheet, a hydraulic device with different forces operating in it, or a television switchboard.",
        "Attempts to understand the mind go back at least to the ancient Greeks. Plato, for example, believed that the mind acquired knowledge through virtue, independently of sense experience. Descartes and Leibniz also believed the mind gained knowledge through thinking and reasoningor, in other words, rationalism.",
        "In contrast to rationalists, empiricists, such as Aristotle, John Locke, and David Hume, believe that the mind gains knowledge from experience.",
        "Combining both rationalism and empiricism, Kant argued that human knowledge depends on both sense experience and innate capacities of the mind.",
        "Scientists are unsure if other types of animals have a mind or if some man-made machines could ever possess a mind.",
        "Historically, there have been three major schools of thought that describe the relationship of the brain and the mind: 1) dualism, which holds that the mind exists independently from the brain; 2) materialism, which argues that the mind is identical to the physical processes of the brain; and 3) idealism, which posits that only mental phenomena exist.",
        "Scientists propose that the human mind evolved largely through the sexual choices our ancestors made, similar to the way a peacocks tail evolved through sexual selection.",
        "In one study, a group of experimenters were given unlabeled samples of both Pepsi and Coke. Not a single tester could tell the difference between the two. The test was repeated with the correct labels attached. Three out of the four testers chose Coke. In fact, the Coke label activated parts of the brain associated with the mind (memory, self-image, and culture) that the Pepsi label didnt.",

        "Early-life stress negatively affects the mind. Abuse, neglect, and harsh or inconsistent discipline in early life increases the risk of depression and anxiety as well as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease.",
        "The term mind is from the Old English gemynd, or memory, and the Proto-Indo-European verbal root *men-, meaning to think, remember. The use of mind to refer to all mental faculties, thought, feelings, memory, and volition developed gradually over the 14th and 15th centuries.",
        "The NSF estimates that a human brain produces as many as 12,000 to 50,000 thoughts per day, depending on how deep a thinker a person is. Most of the so-called random daily thoughts are about our social environment and ourselves.",

Different groups of people were asked how fast the cars were going using different trigger words, such as hit, smashed, collided, bumped, and contacted.The group whose question included the word smashed estimated the cars were going 10 mph faster than the group whose word was contacted. A week later, when participants were asked about broken glass, those who were asked more forceful trigger words reported that there was broken glass even though there was none.",

Psychologists note that even highly educated people believed it because it was on the radio and thus authoritative. They also note that media manipulation of our minds is a regular art form.",
        "Psychologists have noted that in the mind of suicidal people, time seemed to move significantly slower. The suicidal mind also had a more difficult time thinking about the future. Researchers suggest this helped the person withdraw from thinking about past failures and what was perceived as a hopeless future.",
        "The mind of a suicidal person tends to focus increasingly on concrete thought, which is often conveyed in suicide notes. For example, suicide notes tend to be more banal and specific, such as Dont forget to feed the cat. Fake suicide notes, however, tend to include more contemplative language, such asAlways be happy. Psychologists note the suicidal mind is trying to slip into idle mental labor to avoid unpleasant emotions.",
        "Some scientists believe that there may be universal features of the human mind that make it easier for people to believe in a higher power.

He separated a baby monkey from its mother and raised it in a cage with two substitute mothers. One mother was made from wire and had a bottle. The other mother was made from cloth, but didnt have a bottle. As soon the infant finished nursing, it would cling to the cloth monkey. When the experimenters introduced frightening stimulus into the cage, the monkeys ran to the cloth monkey for protection. The monkeys grew up with severe emotional and behavioral problems.",

He suffered from synesthesia, a phenomenon in which one sense (for example, vision) stimulates another sense (such as hearing). Solomons extreme synesthesia led him to taste, smell, and see vivid images in conjunction with numbers and sounds. Because a single word could trigger a flood of memories and associations, he had a difficult time reading a book or having a simple conversation.",
        "The human mind has a difficult time differentiating the innate from the environmental. In other words, if the mind is used to interpreting the world a certain way, it expects that the world is that way naturally and unalterably. For example, for many people, the color pink is naturally feminine and blue is naturally male. However, in the 1920s, parents dressed boys in pink because it was a watered down version of red, which was seen as masculine and fierce. Girls were dressed in pale blue because it was associated with the Virgin Mary.",

He reported that what they did to his body was not as bad as what they did to his mind.",

        "Research has proven how easy it is to create false memories through the force of suggestion. Psychologists found that if they repeated questions (e.g. hugging Bugs Bunny at Disney Worldan impossibility) and invited the mind to imagine sensory detail (do you remember stroking Bugs Bunnys velvety ears), a person would begin to believe it was an actual event.",
        "The mind can practice new tasks, such as learning a new piece of music during REM sleep. REM sleep also appears to boost performance with tasks involving procedural memory, or the subconscious how-to knowledge that a person uses when walking, riding a bike, or performing most physical tasks.",
        "Most people assume that our conscious mind continues until the end of day and then picks up after we wake up. Scientists argue, however, that dreaming is a phenomenon thats just as visceral and immediate as consciousness is and that since we spend roughly 20 years asleep, dreams should be considered an alternate reality.",
        "Advertisers use mind illusions to make their products more appealing. For example, they produce condiment bottles with long necks because the mind is better at judging size than volume. Bottles of maple syrup are narrow at the base but bulge in the middle because that is where a person is most likely to look.",
        "The moon appears to be much larger than usual when its low in the sky because the mind interprets the size of the moon in relation to distant objects and the horizon. But when the moon is high in the sky, the mind has no such frame of reference, and so the moon appears smaller.",
        "Scientists note that the mind is a giant pattern-making machine. It invents shapes and identifiable things to explain odd patterns in arrangements. The mind can also block out things it wants to ignore, such as the tactile sensation of clothes rubbing on a persons skin or a persons own body odor.",
        "The minds power of expectation can blind people to facts and lure them into unwitting conjecture in virtually every way they perceive the world. For example, testers in a study responded differently to an odor that they sniffed out of a test tube depending on whether they were told that it was fancy cheese or human waste.",
        "The mind stores memories in different ways, although the boundaries are not always clear cut: short-term memory (working memory), long-term memory (declarative memory), and procedural memory (how-to memory associated with physical skills such as shoe tying). Procedural memory is remarkably durable and is even able to survive the ravages of diseases like Alzheimers.",
        "Scientists are unsure how things are forgotten; in other words, they are unsure what makes a person unable to remember even long-term memories. New research shows that people dont necessarily forget, they simply lose the ability to retrieve older, rarely visited memories.",
        "Short-term memory is linked to current electrical activity taking place in a persons neurons, or the pattern of signal transmission that goes through the brain. Long-term memory, however, depends on permanent physical changes in the brain.",
        "A humans eye is able to see fine detail in only a small sliver of its visual field. However, the mind uses saccades (quick, automatic eye movements) to compensate for this weakness. The eye performs two or three saccades each second to give the mind a single, seamless whole. When a person is severely drunk, the saccades slow down, and the mind begins to see the world as the eye perceives it, a patch of sharpness surrounded by a blurry field.",

Subjects who viewed their wounded hands through the wrong end of binoculars, which made their hand look smaller, experienced decreased pain and decreased swelling. However, those who looked at the wounded hand through the right side of the binoculars, which made the hand look larger, experienced increased pain.",
        "Some researchers argue that the Internet is changing the structure of our brains, which changes the minds ability to think and to learn. Specifically, the Internet overstimulates the part of the brain involved in temporary memory so that deep thinking and creativity become increasingly difficult.",
        "Researchers note that like a mathematical formula, which is a statement about a number represented by a number, the mind trying to understand the nature of the mind introduces a certain paradoxical loopiness. Scientists use the famous Escher print of a right hand drawing a left hand that in turn is drawing a right hand as a visual example of this paradox.",
        "The mind imagines objects slightly from above and tilted. For example, researchers asked people around the world to draw a coffee cup. Almost everyone drew a coffee cup from a perspective slightly above the cup looking down and offset a little to the right or left. No one drew it looking straight down from above. This uniformity in perspective has been dubbed the canonical perspective."

        "A woman has a wider-ranging peripheral vision, which allows her to check out a mans body from head to toe without getting caught. A males peripheral vision is poorer, which is why a man will move his gaze up and down a womans body in a very obvious way. Men do not oogle more than womentheir tunnel vision means they just get caught more easily.",

Teenagers, in particular, will often sit splayed out on a couch or chair as a nonverbal way to dominate their environment and show disrespect while being chastised. Splaying is also very inappropriate during a job interview since it shows a nonverbal message of disrespect for authority.",
        "Humans like many other animals (e.g., lizards, birds, dogs, and primates) puff up their chests when they are trying to establish territorial dominance. Human males may also bare their torso. Scientists are unsure whether this is to show off muscles, protect discarded clothing, or rob an opponent of a type of hold.",

        "Hand-steepling may be the most powerful high-confidence hand gesture. It involves touching the spread fingertips of both hands in a gesture similar to praying hands, but the fingers are not interlocked and the palms may not be touching. In the U.S., women tend to steeple low (at the waist), while men tend to steeple at chest level.",
        "In contrast to hand-steepling, hand wringing is a universal way of showing distress or concern. A person can go from steepling (high confidence) to fingers interlaced (low confidence) and back to steepling (high confidence), reflecting the ebb and flow of confidence and doubt.",
        "Thumbs can be a powerful form of body language. Often seen with high-status individuals, the thumb sticking out of the pocket is a high-confidence display. Generally when individuals carry their thumbs high, it is a sign they think highly of themselves or are confident.",

      "Human Emotions": [
        "Emotion is typically defined as a response to stimuli that involves physiological changes (increased pulse rate, increased body temperature, activity of certain glands, increased or decreased breathing rate), which motivate a person to act. Simply put, emotions are the feelings of the mind, the equivalent of what physical sensations are to the body.",
        "In Greek myth, many of the ills that plagued mankind were creatures of emotion, such as revenge, spite, and envy. Released by the goddess Pandora, they sought to torment the world.",
        "Ancient doctors believed that different organs controlled certain moods. Happiness, for example, came from the heart, anger from the liver, and fear from the kidneys.",
        "Studies show that connecting a brand to a consumer on an emotional level is one of the most powerful advertising techniques. For example, Nikes pervasive theme of success in sports focuses on a key emotional trigger and that has built sponsorships, advertising, and business empires.",
        "In the 17th century, Ren Descartes viewed the bodys emotional apparatus as largely hydraulic. He believed that when a person felt angry or sad it was because certain internal valves opened and released such fluids as bile and phlegm.",
        "In the English language, there are more than 400 words assigned to emotions and sentiments.",
        "A study in the Journal of Consumer Research notes that people who think more abstractly respond better to ads that portray mixed emotions compared to those who think at a more concrete level.",
        "A recent study suggests a strong correlation between wearing certain clothes and emotional states. For example, it revealed that women who are depressed or sad are more likely to wear baggy tops, sweatshirts, or jeans. Women who had more positive emotions were more likely to wear a favorite dress or jewelry and generally look nicer.",
        "The word emotion is from the Latin emovere, to move out, remove, agitate: from ex-out + movere, to move.",
        "The word instinct is  from the Latin instinctus meaning instigation, impulsewhich is related to the Proto-Indo-European *steig-, to prick, stick, or pierce.",
        "Some researchers fear that technology, particularly social networking, is creating emotional disconnection rather than connection.",
        "Emotional abuse is similar to brainwashing in that it attempts to systematically wear away a persons self-confidence, self-worth, and self-concept. Emotional abuse can take many forms, including using economic power to control, threatening to leave, degrading, belittling, continually criticizing, name calling, or shouting.",
        "Any emotion has three components: 1) physiological changes (e.g., acceleration of heart rate) 2) behavioral response, such as a tendency to escape from or stay in contact with whatever is causing the emotion, and 3) a subjective experience, such as feeling angry, happy, or sad.",
        "Historically, psychologists have disagreed as to whether emotions arise before an action, occur at the same time as an action, or are a response to automatic physiological process.",
        "Most neuroscientists distinguish between the words emotion and feeling. They use emotion to describe the brains auto-programmed response to certain stimuli, and feeling to describe our conscious impression of that response.",
        "Charles Darwin believed that emotions were beneficial for evolution because emotions improved chances of survival. For example, the brain uses emotion to keep us away from a dangerous animal (fear), away from rotting food and fecal matter (disgust), in control of our resources (anger), and in pursuit of a good meal or a good mate (pleasure and lust).",
        "Types of triggers that humans are evolutionarily prepared to fear, such as caged snakes, evoke a visceral response even though humans know they are relatively harmless on a cognitive level. However, humans are less likely to react with fear to dangerous risks that evolution has not prepared them for, such as hamburgers, smoking, and unsafe sex, even though most people recognize the danger on a cognitive level.",
        "Most scientists believe that basic emotions are innate rather than learned. For example, people who are born blind and have never seen faces still display the typical facial expressions of the basic emotions.",
        "A 1980 study by Robert Plutchik proposed eight primary innate emotions: joy, acceptance, fear, surprise, sadness, disgust, anger, and anticipation. He suggests that complex emotions such as guilt and love are derived from combinations of primary emotions.",

        "Colors can profoundly affect emotional responses. While not everyone experiences the same emotion in response to a particular color, most people find reds and oranges stimulating and blues and purples restful. In contrast, gray, brown, black, or white tend to be emotionally dulling. In fact, studies reveal that children playing in an orange room were friendlier, alert, creative, and less irritable than children in playrooms painted white, brown, and black.",
        "Researchers note that when concealing a strong emotion, people tend to let out micro-expressions, or sudden leakages, of emotion unbeknownst to themselves very briefly, in as little as a 24th of a second.",
        "Emotions are contagious. Negative or unpleasant emotions are more contagious than neutral or positive emotions.",
        "Only humans are known to express the emotion astonishment with their mouth agape. However, there appear to be more similarities than differences in the way animals, especially primates, and humans express such basic emotions as anger, fear, happiness, and sadness. In fact, because animals and humans express similar kinds of emotions, Charles Darwin believed the emotional difference between animals and humans is largely one of complexity and not of kind.",
        "Studies show that mothers are less tolerant of crying in boys than in girls, suggesting that the way emotions are expressed by adults are instilled by mothers during the childs infancy.",

        "The visually appealing presentations of unhealthy food in menus subtly arouse emotions in consumers. Scientists argue that if people understood those emotions better, they would make better food choices.",
        "Many psychologists consider instinct and emotion similar in that both are automatic. For example, fear is both an emotion and an instinct. However, while instincts are immediate, irrational, and innate, emotions have the potential to be more rational and part of a complex feedback system linking biology, behavior, and cognition.",
        "While researchers have not found any culture where people spontaneously smile when disgusted or frown when they are happy, they have found some oddities. For example, the Japanese have a harder time discerning anger in a face and they tend to mask their facial expressions of unpleasant feelings more than did Americans.",
        "Of all facial expressions, the smile may be the most deceptive. There are around 18 different smiles, including polite, cruel, false, self-effacing, and so on. But only one reflects genuine happiness; this is known as the Duchenne smile, in honor of the French neurologist who determined this phenomenon, Guillaume-Benjamin-Amand Duchenne (de Boulogne).",

        "Plato described emotion and reason as two horses pulling us in opposite directions. However, modern neurologist Antonio Damasio argues that reasoning depends on emotion and is not in opposition to emotion.",
        "Body language often reveals emotion. For example, a person standing with their arms on hips with elbows turned outward is an example of a territorial display. Someone with their hands folded and their thumbs popped up indicates that he or she has something positive to say. Touching the nose indicates someone is hiding something. A former FBI agent and specialist in nonverbal communication states that the feet provide the strongest body language signals.",
        "Studies reveal that people recognize and interpret the emotional facial expressions of those in their own race faster than those who are a different race.",
        "From silent films to cartoons such as Tom and Jerry to films such as Psycho and Jaws, music is a widely used stimulus that evokes a variety of emotional responses. Generally music in a major key is happy, while music in a minor key is sad. Spoken voices also reflect this tonality. Interestingly, certain emotional tones in music are cross-cultural.",
        "A study of those with amnesia found that the emotions tied to a memory outlast the memories that created them. Researchers note this has important implications for those with Alzheimers disease.",
        "Using its site WeFeelFine.org, Stanford University analyzed around 13 million emotions that have been recorded on the Web since 2005. They found older people are usually happier, but for different reasons. Younger people are happy when they are excited, older people are happier when they are at peace. Additionally, women tend to feel more loved than men, but also feel more guilt. Men often feel happier, yet lonelier. They also found that the happiest time of day is lunchtime.",
        "A human can make over 10,000 facial expressions to express a wide variety of subtle emotions.",

        "The U.S. debt ceiling was created in 1917 at a limit of $11.5 billion during WWI to allow greater simplicity and flexibility during the war by allowing the Treasury to borrow any amount it needed as long as the amount was below this limit. Prior to this, Congress had to approve each issuance of debt. To change the debt ceiling, Congress needs to enact specific legislation and the President must approve the legislation.",

        "The only democratic country besides the U.S. with a debt ceiling is Denmark. However, its ceiling is so high it is it unlikely to ever be reached. The Danish set the ceiling so high to avoid slowing the process of borrowing money and to avoid political conflicts similar to those current in the U.S.",
        "Many economists consider the global financial crisis (GFC), or the late-2000s financial crisis, to be the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. The crisis was caused by a complex interplay of subprime lending, growth of the housing bubble, easy credit conditions, poor underwriting practices, predatory lending (e.g., Countrywide Financial would swap a low interest rate for a more expensive one the day of closing), deregulation, and increased debt. The immediate trigger, however, was the bursting of the housing bubble, which had peaked between 2005 and 2006.",

        "Even though countries such as Germany and France have high output and manageable debt, the size of other countries debt is putting the whole Eurozone in trouble. Consequently, investors dont want to buy bonds from any European country because even those who have manageable debt might have to assume responsibility for those weaker countries.",
        "Some economists note that Germany and France, which have the strongest economy in the Eurozone, encouraged the PIIGs (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain) to go into debt. German and French banks lent money to the PIIGS so that the PIIGS could buy German and French goods and services, just like a junkie setting up an addict.",
        "Some critics blame the Euro currency for the European debt crisis, arguing that a single currency to meet the needs of 17 different economies is inherently flawed.

After Greece revealed its number, investors panicked, the country could not fund itself, it was forced to take a 110 billion bailout from the IMF, and it is due to receive a second bailout package in 2012.",
        "Troubled European nations, such as Greece, have implemented austerity measures in an attempt to control massive debt. Some austerity measures include cuts to public sector pay and pensions, reduced benefits, and increased taxes. However, austerity economics have been met not only with public opposition but also speculation that spending cuts and higher taxes will reduce demands for goods and services just when an increase is needed.",
        "The majority of EU member states have agreed on a new treaty that could stave off a Eurozone collapse.

      "Whales": [
        "Whales belong to the order cetacean, meaning they are mammals that are\nfully adapted to aquatic life. Like dolphins and porpoises, whales are\nbelieved to have descended from land animals that returned to the water\nroughly 50 million years ago after living millions of years on land.",
        "There are two suborders of whales to which all species of whales belong:\ntoothed whales and baleen whales. Toothed whales include sperm, killer,\nand beluga whales, and they prey on large fish in deep waters as their\nmain source of food. Baleen whales include blue and humpback whales, and\nthey are filter feeders that feed on small organisms such as krill and\nplankton by straining large amounts of sea water through a comb-like structure\nin their mouth called a baleen.",
        "Because whales must rise to the surface often to breathe, only one half\nof their brain sleeps at a time. This process allows their body to get\nadequate rest while still providing for the necessary function of breathing\nto survive.",
        "Most etymologists believe the word whale comes from the\nHigh German word hwal, but it is also possible that it derived\nfrom the Old English word for wheel since the back of a whale\nrolling at the surface of the water resembles the rim of a large, submerged\nwheel.",
        "As mammals, whales are warm-blooded and maintain a body temperature similar\nto that of a human. In cold water temperatures, whales maintain their body\ntemperature by forming a thick wall of fat (often called blubber) to insulate\ntheir bodies.",
        "Whales and other cetaceans move through the water by plunging their tails\nup and down in a vertical motion. This action distinguishes them from fish,\nwhich move their tails from side to side when swimming.",
        "The blue whale is the largest of all whales and is also considered the\nlargest animal to have ever existed in the world. An adult blue whale can\nmeasure up to 108 feet in length and can weigh nearly 200 tons.",
        "When a blue whale dives into the water, its head is already deeper than\nmost scuba divers dare to go before its tail leaves the surface of the\nwater.",
        "Sperm whales can dive as deep as two miles into the water, and their\nbodies have unique physiological adaptations to allow them to survive the\nintense cold and crushing pressure of these dives. They can limit circulation\nto the brain and other organs, slow the heart to 10 beats per minute to\nconserve oxygen, and collapse the lungs and rib cage to withstand pressure.",
        "Prior to the invention of deep submersible boats, the sole source of\nknowledge about the oceans depths came from scientific examination\nof the stomach contents of sperm whales. The sperm whale often dives below\n10,000 feet in pursuit of squid but must return to the surface in order\nto breathe.",
        "Fluking is the term used for when a whale lifts its tail\nout of the water prior to making a deep dive. Because each whale species tail\nhas unique features, fluking allows whale observers to identify species\nat a distance.",
        "Whales do not drink seawater; instead, they extract water from their\nfood by metabolizing the fat.",
        "Biologists believe that whales (and modern hoofed animals) evolved from\na group of extinct land mammals called mesonychid condylarths. The mesonychids\nresembled a slim wart hog without the tusks, according to renditions of\nthe extinct species.",
        "Scientists are not sure why whales jump out of the water, often called breaching. While\nearly whalers thought breaching was a whales method of taunting\nthe fishermen, many biologists now believe breaching is a whales\nway of demonstrating stamina and strength to prospective mates, which may\nbe able to determine the energy of a breach from the sound and frequency\nof the splashes.",
        "The humpback whale breaches more often than any other whale, sometimes\nleaving the water completely during a leap. The whale leaps by swimming\nquickly forward and then turning its spout suddenly upward to send its\nforward momentum skyward. This is quite a feat considering that a humpback\nwhale can weigh as much as 30 tons.",
        "Baleen whales use sonar to communicate with one another, emitting low-frequency\nsounds that can travel enormous distances under water. The bass notes uttered\nby baleen whales are the loudest natural noises made by any animal.",
        "Whales have no natural predators aside from humans, who have hunted the\nlarge mammals for thousands of years for their meat and other raw materials.\nAs early as 3000 B.C., Inuit populations hunted gray whales using only\nstones, driftwood, and the body parts of other animals as weapons.",
        "Most species of toothed whales live in matrilineal pods, dominated by\nmothers, aunts, daughters, and sisters. Males typically stay with a pod\nfor only a year or two after birth and then leave to visit other female\npods to mate.",
        "Because whales typically use hearing as their primary sense, they have\nvery small eyes in proportion to their overall body size.",
        "Legends exist in many cultures of whales that have saved the lives of\nfishermen and sailors. One such account came from whaler James Bartley.\nIn 1891 he published his first-hand story of how he fell overboard from\nhis ship, was immediately swallowed by a sperm whale, and then survived\nin the whales stomach for an hour while his shipmates caught and\nbutchered the whale. Most modern experts dismiss the account as a hoax,\narguing that a person could survive no more than a few minutes in the stomach\nof a whale.",
        "While ancient fishermen used the meat of whales for food, in the modern\nera whales were primarily hunted for oil and whalebone, a term used for\nthe baleen. Whalebone was used to make corsets, umbrella ribs, handles,\nand brushes, while the oil was used for cooking, candle wax and, much later,\nmaking margarine.",
        "During the height of commercial whaling in the nineteenth and early twentieth\ncenturies, the large baleen whales were the most highly sought after and,\nconsequently, they now experience the lowest population levels. Of the\n11 known species of baleen whales, nine are officially endangered with\npopulation numbers that are just a small fraction of what they were 100\nyears ago.",
        "In 1986, the International Whaling Commission (IWC) declared a moratorium\non commercial whaling in response to the severe depletion of many whale\nspecies. There are now only a few nations that practice commercial whaling.",
        "Sperm whales were the most highly prized specimens of the whaling era,\ndue to the spermaceti organ contained in a sperm whales large, bulbous\nforehead. The spermaceti organ of a large male can hold up to 500 gallons\nof oil.",
        "The first whale species to be decimated to near extinction by the whaling\nindustry was the right whale, so named because it was the right whale\nto catch for its relatively slow swimming speed, proximity to the shore,\nand high yield of oil and baleen.",
        "Most toothed whales hunt their prey using echolocation by bouncing a\nclicking sound off of a nearby object, such as a squid, and measuring the\ndistance by the amount of time it takes for the echo to travel back. In\nthe dark depths of the ocean, hearing is their most vital sense.",
        "A whales visible exhalation is typically called the blow or spout.\nScientists believe that the visible mist in the air forming the spout is\na combination of moisture condensed from the whales breath and mucous\nsprayed from the nasal passages.",
        "One of the most famous books written about whales, Moby Dick by\nHerman Melville, features a whalers relentless hunt for an elusive\nwhite sperm whale. Rare albino sperm whales are often called Moby Dicks\nafter the books title character.",
        "The beluga whale is the only member of the cetacean order capable of\nfacial expressions. The lips of the beluga and the crescent of fat that\nforms the forehead are both highly mobile, causing the whale to appear\nas if it were smiling or frowning at times.",
        "The killer whale, or orca, is the fastest of all the whale species and\namong the swiftest of all marine animals with a capable swimming speed\nof 35 miles per hour. Only tuna, marlin, sailfish, and swordfish are faster.",
        "Off the Pacific coast of British Columbia, killer whales often come to rubbing\nbeachesshallow bays lined with smooth rocks. The whales rub\ntheir bodies against the rocks, and scientists believe the action may be\nfor no other reason than the sheer pleasure of it.",
        "All killer whales are marked by defining patches of white on their black\nskin. While there is some regularity to the pattern of white patches, the\nmarkings are distinct enough among individual whales to allow them to distinguish\nbetween one another, even in murky water.",
        "An adult hunchback whale may be the host to as many as half a ton of\nbarnacles. In an attempt to remove the hitch-hiking barnacles and the drag\nthey cause, whales slough off patches of skin continuously.",
        "Gray whales were once known as devilfish, due to the ferocity\nwith which a female gray whale will protect its young. While whalers would\nsometimes harpoon a humpback or bowhead calf in order to lure its mother\nto the same fate, the wrath of a mother gray whale was far too risky for\nsuch a trick. Enraged females were known to smash or overturn the whalers open\nboats in retaliation.",
        "The blue whale can weigh over 200 tons but feeds exclusively on krilla\ncrustacean smaller than a childs finger. The massive mammals gain\nmuch of their weight while they are nursed by their mothers, with a blue\nwhale calf gaining approximately 250 pounds every day during its first\nthree weeks of life.",
        "The long, pointed tusks of the narwhal, a toothed whale that lives year-round\nin the Arctic, were often passed off as unicorn horns during the fifteenth\nand sixteenth centuries and could be sold for four times their weight in\ngold. Buyers of the misrepresented horns believed they could\nserve as protections against poisoning.",
        "Scientists believe that blue whales can live as long as humans, but the\nanimals are so elusive that it is difficult to track an individual whales\nage. The oldest known individual blue whale is named Nubbin and was photographed\nin 1970 and again in 2008.",
        "On land, an animal the size of the blue whale would be crushed by its\nweight without the support of large, heavy bones. Because it is supported\nby water as a marine animal, the need for large, heavy bones is eliminated,\nallowing the blue whale to reach such a massive size."

        "Stegosaurus had huge upright plates on its back that could grow as large as 30 inches. While scientists do not fully understand the function of these massive plates, they speculate that the stegosaurus could control its body temperature by regulating blood flow through them. A stegosaurus may have also been able to control its skin color this way, to either attract a mate or scare predators. Scientists call this color change blushing.",

        "The first known American dinosaur was discovered in 1858 in the marl pits in Haddonfield, New Jersey. Although other fossils were previously found, they were not correctly identified as dinosaur fossils.",
        "There was such fierce rivalry between paleontologists Edward Cope and Othniel Marsh to find new dinosaurs fossils that they spawned what became known as the Bone Wars. The fight lasted for over 30 years. Marsh is said to have won the wars, in part because he found more fossils and he was better funded.",
        "Paleontologists are not perfect. For example, Gideon Mantell (1790-1852) put Iguanodons thumb claw on top of its nose. It stayed that way for 40 years. Edward Cope (1840-1897) reconstructed Elasmosaurus (thin plate) with its head on the end of its tail. Until recently, Apatosaurus (or Brontosaurus) appeared in museums with the head of Camarasaurus (chambered lizard).",
        "Current dinosaur fossil hot spots include South America (particularly Argentina) and China, where several feathered dinosaurs have been found.",
        "Dinosaur names are not always static. For example, when paleontologist Othniel C. Marsh first discovered the bones of a giant sauropod, he named it Apatosaurus. When he discovered similar but larger bones a little later, he named it Brontosaurus. However, what Marsh thought were Brontosaurs bones were actually adult Apatosaurus bones, so later scientists decided to change Brontosaurus back to Apatosaurus.h\n\nTimeline g,h\n\n\n4.6 Billion Years Ago\n\n\nEarth, its moon, and the solar system form.\n\n\n3.8 Billion Years Ago\n\n\nOne-celled life forms develop.\n\n\n570 Million Years Ago\n\n\nFirst fish appear.\n\n\n400-350 Million Years Ago\n\n\nPlants thrive.\n\n\n350 Million Years Ago\n\n\nAmphibians (cold-blooded animals that live on water and\nland) appear on land.\n\n\n330 Million Years Ago\n\n\nPrimitive reptiles, the first beings to live completely on land, appear.

        "The eyespots of a giant panda cub are initially in the shape of a circle. As the cub grows, the circles become shaped like a teardrop.",
        "Giant pandas are on the brink of extinction, with just over 1,000 pandas left in the world. Scientists are hoping to increase the wild panda population to 5,000 by 2025.",
        "The giant panda has been on the endangered species list since 1990. The most significant threats to pandas are habitat loss and poaching. China is only approximately 5% greater than the U.S. in area but has four times the population.",
        "Many Chinese philosophers believe that the universe is made from two opposing forces, the Yin and Yang. The panda is one symbol of this philosophy with its contrasting black-and-white fur. The Chinese believe that the gentle nature of the panda demonstrates how the Yin and Yang bring peace and harmony when they are balanced.",
        "Pandas have been a symbol of peace in China. For example, hundreds of years ago, warring tribes in China would raise a flag with a picture of a panda on it to stop a battle or call a truce.",
        "Pandas have lived on Earth for two to three million years.",
        "The red panda and the giant panda share the same habitat and diet, and both animals are also endangered. However, scientific tests show that the red panda is in the raccoon family while the giant panda is in the bear family. Some scientists believe that the giant panda is so special that it should belong to its own family group.",
        "According to legend, the panda was once an all-white bear. When a small girl tried to save a panda cub from being attacked by a leopard, the leopard killed the girl instead. Pandas came to her funeral wearing armbands of black ashes. As they wiped their eyes, hugged each other, and covered the ears, they smudged the black ashes.",
        "Pandas can stand upright, but their short hind legs arent strong enough to support their bodies. A pandas bones are twice as heavy as the bones of other animals the same size.",
        "Pandas are pigeon-toed; in other words, they walk with their front paws turned inward.",
        "Pandas do not run fasta slow trot is as fast as they can go. The fastest bear is the black bear, which can run 35 miles per hour. Thats about as a fast as a horse or deer.",
        "Female pandas ovulate only once a year. They are fertile only two or three days of the year.",
        "Giant panda cubs are usually born in August or September and are the size of a stick of butter. A cub has pink skin, a thin coat of white fur, a long tail, and no teeth. Its eyes are closed. By the end of the first month, the baby panda has all of its spots. Its eyes open around 4-6 weeks. A baby panda is almost 2 months old before it is the size of an average human newborn baby. A baby is almost 2 years old when it leaves its mother.",
        "Pandas rely less on visual memory than they do on spatial memory to locate a mates home range area and preferred patches of bamboo. Spatial memory is defined as the ability to remember a location.",
        "It takes about five years for a female cub to become an adult and up to seven years for a male cub.",
        "There are only about 240 captive pandas in the world. They are all part of a breeding program.",
        "The ancestor of the giant panda is the Ailurarctos (cat bear), which is an extinct genus of the Chinese panda that lived 8 million years ago. The skull of another ancestor, Ailuropoda microta, shows that it was half the size of a modern-day giant panda. Research shows that for the past 3 million years, giant pandas have evolved as a separate linage from other bears.",
        "Pandas have plantigrade feet. This means their entire foot (toes and heel) touches the ground when walking, which is similar to the way humans, other bears, and rodents walk. Other animals, such as dogs, cats, and horses walk with their weight on their toes.",

        "A panda fur is worth between $60,000 and $100,000 on the illegal trade market.",
        "Young pandas stay with the mothers for as long as three years, which means that a wild panda may raise only three or four cubs in a lifetime.",

        "Panda researchers have counted 11 different panda callsand four of them are used only when searching for a mate.",
        "An adult giant panda weighs about 200-300 pounds (90-135 kg).",

        "Although a giant pandas fur looks silky and soft, it is quite thick and wiry. The hair of an adult giant panda can grow up to 4 inches (10 cm) long.",
        "Scientists are unsure why the giant panda has the markings it has. Some biologists believe the pandas colors are camouflage of light and dark to help the panda hide in the shadows in a bamboo forest. Other scientists believe the black and white markings help the panda keep a steady temperature, or that the colors help the giant panda avoid other pandas. Still other biologists believe that the pandas large black eyespots make their eyes look bigger and their stare more aggressive.",
        "A giant pandas face is cute, but it is not chubby. It gets its shape from massive cheek muscles. In fact, a giant pandas jaw and cheek muscles are so powerful that a panda can easily chew an aluminum dish into tiny pieces. They can also easily bite through a thick bamboo stalk. Humans have trouble cutting the same stalk with an ax.",

Nixon was the first U.S. president to ever visit China.",
        "A pandas entire mating process takes only about two or three days. Once they have mated, females chase the males out of their territory and raise their cubs on their own.",
        "The gestation period for giant pandas varies from 97-163 days. This wide range is due to delayed implantation, which means that after a giant panda becomes pregnant, the cub starts to grow only if the mother panda is able to get enough food. Once the cub starts to develop, it takes about 45-60 days before it is born.",
        "A giant panda usually gives birth to a single cub. Sometimes twins are born, but when this happens, the mother typically ignores the weaker cub. She does not have enough energy to care for two cubs.",

        "Giant pandas have been driven out of the lowland areas where they used to live and now are found only in the Chinese provinces of Sichuan, Gansu, and Shaanxi. The forests in these provinces are very damp and rainy. In one year, a forest may receive up to 50 inches of rain and snow.",
        "Giant pandas do not hibernate because their bamboo diet will not allow them to build up enough fat reserves for the winter.",
        "Much of the food that a giant panda eats is not digested. An adult giant panda in the spring can produce about 62 pounds of droppings in 24 hours.",
        "There are 300 species of bamboo in China. There are about 25 different kinds in the mountains where the pandas live. Pandas especially like to eat umbrella, arrow, and golden bamboo.",
        "Although 99% of their diet is bamboo, a pandas digestive system is designed for meat. In fact, pandas absorb only 20%-30 % of bamboo nutrients. Other plant eaters such as deer absorb around 80%. This means the panda has to eat most of the time it is awake to get enough nutrients to survive.",
        "The Sichuan tribe in China believes that panda urine can desolve a swallowed needle. They also believe that sleeping on a panda pelt helps keep away ghosts and helps foretell the future. In the Quin dynasty (220 B.C.), an early dictionary called Er Ya, claimed that a pandas pelt could help control menses.",
        "Keeping even a single panda in a zoo is expensive. A panda costs five times more to keep than the next most expensive animal, an elephant.",

        "There are no recorded artistic representations of giant pandas before the 20th century.",
        "Bamboo reaches its flowering cycle every 30-120 years. After bamboo flowers, the entire species of bamboo dies in a process called bamboo dieback. It can take up to 10-15 years for the bamboo to grow back. Pandas have usually been able to migrate to other areas, but they have lost so much of thier habitant to humans that migration has become increasingly difficult.",
        "It is very rare to see more than one panda at a time in the wild. Giant pandas cannot afford the energy it would take to compete with one another for food, territory, and mates.",

        "In China, giant pandas are considered to be national treasures.",
        "It was not until the 20th century that giant pandas became known to the rest of the world outside of China. The first live giant Panda to leave China  in 1936 was named Su-Lin (a little bit of something very cute). He arrived at the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago.",
        "Fashion designer and socialite Ruth Harkness (1900-1947), without training or experience, became the first Westerner to capture and present a live giant panda to the world outside China.",
        "Giant pandas have been the symbol of the international conservation organization WWF, or the World Wide Fund for Nature, since it was founded in 1961.",
        "Some scientists believe that the giant panda is a remnant species, meaning that it is becoming extinct naturally, not just because of human activity. Other scientists believe that the pandas problems are directly caused by humans.",
        "There are about 15 giant pandas in zoos outside of China. Chinese zoos display another 90 captive animals.",
        "Under its fur, the skin of a giant panda is black where its fur is black, and pink where its fur is white.",

        "It has been illegal to kill pandas in China since the 1960s, but the laws were not enforced strictly. In 1987, the laws were strengthened to increase punishment from two years to a life sentence or even death. Today the punishment is less severe: 10-20 years in prison.",
        "Unlike the rest of the bear family, pandas do not use facial expressions to communicate. When one panda wants to threaten another, it stares at its opponent with its head down. Researchers believe a panda may do that so that its black ears will look like another pair of eyes against the white fur of its neck.",
        "Pandas have sometimes been seen rolling down slopes. While they may be playing, they may also be trying to dislodge twigs from their fur."

Larger penguins, such as Emperor Penguins, can dive as far as 1,870 feet for as long as 22 minutes, making it the deepest-diving nonflying bird and the longest submerged bird. An Emperor Penguin has solid bones rather than air-filled bones, which eliminates the risk of barotrauma. Their heart rate slows to 15-20 beats per minute and nonessential organs shut down during long dives.",

Shark teeth are\nused to make necklaces; cartilage is used to make fertilizers; skin is\nused to make leather; liver is used to make face cream, sap, and fuel;\nand fins are used to make soup. The mass killing of sharks creates a negative,\ncascading effect in the global environment.",

        "Wilhelm Roentgen, the scientist who discovered X-rays, was awarded the very first Nobel Prize in Physics in 1901. He refused to take patents out related to his discovery because he wanted humankind as a whole to benefit.",
        "X-radiation or X-ray is a form of high-energy electromagnetic radiation. Other types of EM radiation that make up the electromagnetic spectrum are microwaves, infrared light, visible light, ultraviolet light, and gamma rays. They all travel in waves, but have different wavelengths.",
        "The first X-ray (or roentgenogram) was of Roentgens wifes hand, complete with wedding ring, in 1895. His wife was less than impressed and declared: I have seen my death!",
        "From identifying broken bones to disease, the X-ray is one of the most useful medical advancements in history. It is also the oldest and most common form of imaging.",
        "X-rays can be divided into hard X-rays and soft X-rays. Because hard X-rays have higher energy and, therefore, higher penetrative ability, they are used in medical radiography and airport security.",
        "The variant spellings of X-ray in the English language include x-ray, xray, and X ray.",
        "The effect of X-rays is cumulative, which means that minor doses over several years can equal a large dose at one time.",
        "The term X-ray is used to refer to both the image itself and to the method.",
        "X-rays have enough energy to ionize atoms and disrupt molecular bonds, which makes them harmful to living tissue.",
        "CAT scanners can take thousands of X-rays to make up one image. While X-rays can take pictures of our bones, CT scans can take photographs of the bodys internal organs, such as the heart, liver, and kidneys.",
        "Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen was mystified by the radiation he had discovered when he discovered X-rays, so he temporarily called them X-rays, with the x being a mathematical symbol for something unknown. Although he objected, the name stuck, though X-rays are occasionally called Roentgen rays in German-speaking countries.",
        "Rontgen had used a zinc box and a lead plate  for his X-ray beams, which protected the photographic plates in his lab from being accidentally exposed. This coincidentally protected him.

        "In 2011, a portion of the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill required lenders to disclose credit scores to applicants.",
        "Credit scoring is rife with controversy, including vulnerability to errors. The rise in automated lending decisions, the billions of pieces of data handled each day, as well as the explosion of identity theft has left major rooms for error in scoring.",
        "More than 8 million people fall victim to identity theft in the U.S. each year. Consumers spend hundreds of millions of hours trying to resolve the problem, stop the fraud, and clear up their credit reports.",
        "Credit scoring has been criticized for its complexity. The variety of different scoring formulas and different approaches among lenders causes confusion for consumers and mortgage professionals alike.",
        "In the United Sates, credit scores dont factor in income, race, religion, and ethnicity. However, it is not clear whether the result of these formulas is actually nondiscriminatory. For example, seasonal work is prevalent in some neighborhoods, which can lead to a higher rate of nonpayment in the off-season.",
        "A person does not have one credit score. They have many, and they change all the time. There is more than one credit-scoring system. In fact, currently more than 100 credit-scoring models are being marketed to lenders. The best known score, however, is the FICO, and a person is more likely to be affected by their FICO score than any other.",
        "The classic FICO formulas need at least one account on a credit report that has been open for 6 months and one account thats been updated in the past 6 months.",
        "Credit-scoring systems were designed for lenders, not consumers. This means that scores werent created to be easy to understand, and the actual formulas and the details of how they work are closely guarded trade secrets.",
        "Many lenders use 720 or 740 as the cutoff for giving borrowers their best rates and terms. Many also use 660, 640, or 620. Borrowers below those numbers are called subprime.",
        "The Great Recession had a significant impact on the credit-scoring world. More people fell into the lower brackets: 25% had scores under 600 in October 2010, compared to 15% in 2006.",
        "Insurers have discovered a strong link between the quality of a persons credit and the likelihood a person will file a claim. The worse your credit score is, the more likely you will cost an insurer money. The better your credit is, the less likely you will have an accident or suffer an insured loss.",
        "More than 90% of homeowners and auto insurers use credit scoring to decide who to cover and what premiums to charge. Many consumers and consumer advocates are outraged that homeowners and auto insurances use credit scoring to determine whom they will cover.",
        "About half of Americans dont have a single late payment on their credit reports. Approximately four in 10 have been 60 days or more overdue in the past 7 years.",
        "The five most important factors that affect a FICO score are 1) payment history (35%), 2) how much you owe (30%), 3) how long youve had credit (15%), 4) your last application for credit (10%), and 5) the types of credit you use (10%).",
        "To get the highest possible credit scores, a person needs both revolving debts, such as credit cards, and installment debts, such as mortgages or auto loans.",
        "Major credit cards (VISA, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and Diners Club) are typically better for a credit score than department or finance companies.",
        "The average American has 13 credit accounts showing on their credit report, including nine credit cards and four installment loans.",
        "A high credit score can save a person tens of thousands of dollars in mortgage interest, lower auto insurance premiums, and can even increase the likelihood of getting hired.",
        "Most Americans use less than 30% of their available credit limits. Only 1 in 6 uses 80% or more.",
        "In the United States, there are three major credit bureaus: Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian. Each bureau tracks how credit is used and each issues its own credit score. Because each bureau has slightly different information, their scores tend to vary, sometimes significantly.",
        "There is a difference between credit reports and credit scores. Reports show a persons history of using credit, including both opened and closed accounts, payment history, credit limits, and amounts owed. The score (a FICO score) is based on this information and ranges from a low of 300 to a high of 850.",
        "Under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (the FACT Act), a person can get a free credit report once each year from each of the three major credit bureaus by going to AnnualCreditReport.com. However, these reports do not include the FICO credit score.",
        "Credit scores affect more than home mortgage rates and car loans. They also affect how much a person pays for car insurance. Additionally, employers and landlords can pull credit reports on potential employees and renters.",
        "A person getting his or her own credit report does not hurt the score. However, inquiries by creditors from whom a person has applied for credit can lower a score.",
        "Maxing out credit cards damages credit scores by 10 to 45 points.",
        "Even with a bankruptcy or foreclosure, it is still possible to improve a credit score. Negative references do not remain on credit reports forever.",
        "Some variation of the FICO score is used in 19 countries outside the U.S.",
        "Over 144 million people, or 2/3 of American adults, havent looked at their credit report in the last year.",
        "Over 1/3 of Americans adults admit that they do not know their credit score.",
        "Closing credit card accounts will hurt a credit score. Experts recommend keeping the oldest card active as along as possible, even if it is used just once or twice a year. The longer a card is open, the more it positively affects a credit score. Length of credit history makes up 15% of a persons credit score.",
        "Closing a credit card line can hurt the all-important credit utilization ratio by reducing the amount of credit someone is approved for compared to his or her total amount of debt.",
        "Increasing credit card limit can boost a credit score as long as the card is not maxed out.",
        "A negative mark on a credit history disappears after seven years. So if an unpaid debt is close to this cutoff date, a person may want to let it be. Additionally, if someone makes a payment to an old debt, the debt may be re-aged so it looks like a recent problem. Newer negative activity is weighed more heavily than older activity.",
        "Not all debt affects a credit score equally. Installment debt, such as student loans and mortgages, dont take as large a toll because they are paid off in installments. However, revolving debt, such as credit card debt, lowers a credit score much more.",
        "Your credit utilization rate, or how much you can borrow, is a significant part of a credit score. Experts suggest not going over 30% of your credit line. For example, if a credit card as a $5,000 limit, you should not spend over $1,500 on that line.",
        "While paying a bill late is never a good idea, late payments are usually not reported to credit bureaus until 30 days overdue.h\n\n\nWhat Damages a Credit Score? d,g\n\n\n1. Paying a credit card late\n\n\n2. Forgetting about a bank account with a tiny balance\n\n\n3. Closing a credit card account\n\n\n4. Opening too many store credit cards\n\n\n5.

      "Blonde Hair": [
        "Hair color is based on how much melanin, or pigmentation, is in the hair. Two types of melanin create hair color: 1) eumelanin and 2) phaeomelanin. The more eumelanin a person has, the darker their hair will be. Phaeomelanin works in a similar way, except instead of causing hair to be blacker, it causes hair to be more red. Low levels of both eumelanin and phaeomelanin characterize blonde hair.",

      "Birth Order": [
        "The first theorist to suggest that birth order can affect human psychology was Alfred Adler (1870-1937). In short, he argued that firstborns are dethroned by a second child, which permanently affects the firstborns personality. Additionally, younger and older children may be spoiled and pampered, which also permanently affects their later personalities.",
        "When discussing birth order, it is important to note that there are other various, influential factors related to the development of personality, including family size, sex of each child, sibling deaths, relationship between parents, how critical parents are, and family blending due to divorce or death.",
        "Researchers note that men may be more likely to be homosexual if they share their birth mother with older brothers. Each older brother increases a mans odds of being homosexual by approximately 33%.",
        "Researchers distinguish between actual birth order or ABO (the numerical rank order into which someone is born) and psychological birth order, or PBO (self-perceived position in the family). Actual and psychological birth order can vary for various reasons, including illness of one child, family size, and degree of separation between siblings.",
        "Parents may impose their own stereotypes about birth order on their children which, in turn, creates self-fulfilling prophecies. In other words, a firstborn child may feel like a leader because his parents handed him this role early in life. Or a firstborn will believe he is smarter and approach a testing situation with more self-confidence, thus, boosting his score.",
        "Some researchers say that the apparent disadvantages middle children endure can help them be more empathetic, independent, and articulate.",

        "When there is a five- to six-year gap between children, the next child starts a new family and new birth order.",
        "Sometimes extenuating circumstances tweak the natural birth order sequences so that a later-born child may act like a firstborn, or a firstborn can seem to have characteristics that are inconsistent with the way firstborns are supposed to act.",
        "One researcher advises parents not to adopt a child who is older than any biological children they already have. The younger biological child may feel dethroned by the adopted child.",
        "Generally speaking, children are affected and influenced the most by whoever is directly above them in the family.",
        "Second-born children are known for going the opposite direction from the firstborn in the family.",
        "Because firstborns are often given more responsibility at home (e.g., babysitting younger siblings, helping with chores), they can be quick to take charge.",
        "Famous youngest siblings include Prince Harry, Blake Lively, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy, Martin Short, Ellen DeGeneres, Whoopi Goldberg, Jay Leno, Stephen Colbert, Steve Carell, Jon Stewart, Billy Crystal, Danny DeVito, Drew Carey, Jim Carey, Steve Martin,  Chevy Chase, John Candy, and Charlie Chaplin.",
        "Approximately, 1,300 new blended families form every day in the U.S. Approximately 40% of all marriages represent a remarriage of one or both parties. If remarriages continue at this rate, 35% of all children born will live in a stepfamily by the time they reach 18. Approximately 1 in 6 children under the age of 18 is a stepchild.",
        "Blended families do not automatically create new birth orders, especially if the children are older. Specifically, after the age of 5 or 6, personalities are already mainly formed, which means the firstborn is always a firstborn, a middle child is always a middle child, and so on.",
        "A 2007 study showed a correlation between IQ and birth order: the more older siblings one has, the lower ones IQ.",
        "Firstborn personalities can be created by being the oldest of your sex, having a 5-year (or more) gap between you and the child above you of the same sex, or achieving a role reversal and taking over the firstborn privileges and responsibilities.",

        "One marriage counselor noted that the most competitive, most volatile, and most discouraging marriage combinations are where both spouses are firstborns or, worse, only children.",
        "One marriage counselor noted that the first principal (not a rule) for riskier marriage is to marry someone in your own birth order. In other words, a firstborn marrying a first born or a middle child marrying a middle child.",
        "A middle child who marries another middle child desires peace at any price, which can actually lead to avoidance. Their marriage may have a quiet surface with all kinds of storms brewing underneath. They are more likely to not communicate well because they feel it isnt worth the hassle to confront each other.",
        "A couple consisting of two last-borns is more likely to get into debt.",
        "Last-borns or only children who marry other last-borns make the best match. The next most successful marriage pairing are middle children and last-borns.",
        "If there is one generalization someone could make about middle children is that they feel squeezed or dominatedor what has been known as the Middle Child Syndrome.",
        "Middle children are less likely to be spoiled and, therefore, they tend to be less frustrated and demanding of life.",
        "Because only-children spend so much time alone, they tend to be self-entertainers and often tend to be the most creative of all birth orders. One researcher calls them Super First Borns. Like firstborns, they are confident, pay attention to detail, and tend to do well in school.",
        "The way parents treat their children is as important as the childrens birth order, spacing, sex, and physical or mental characteristics. The key question is this: do parents provide a loving, accepting, and warm environment or was it critical, cold, and distant?",
        "Because firstborns follow their parents lead and they dont have older siblings to make fun of them, they like taking charge and have more confidence. Additionally, parents are more likely to praise every firstborns first milestone, which also can lead to more confidence.",
        "Firstborns are often used to being the center of attention. In fact, an oldest child will have approximately 3,000 more hours of quality time with his or her parents between ages 4 and 13 than the next sibling will get.",
        "Because firstborns tend to be perfectionists, they may be afraid of making mistakes and resist taking action. They may also have trouble admitting when theyre wrong.",
        "Famous middle children include Donald Trump, Elijah Wood, Bill Gates, Princess Diana, and Martin Luther King, Jr.",

        "When a child is born with special needs, younger siblings may take on the firstborn role.",

        "Twins usually dont follow typical birth order roles in Western nations. However, when twins are born vaginally, the firstborn is usually bigger and the other is usually at greater risk for health problems. Consequently, parents may consciously treat the first twin more like a firstborn.",
        "Because middle-borns are sandwiched between younger and older siblings who wanted things done their way, middle children are often the ones to propose to compromise, often at their own expense.",
        "Researchers are unsure why, but middle-borns tend to leave home relatively earlier than their siblings.",
        "Because last-borns tend to focus so much of their attention on what others can do for them, they are less likely to set goals or be organized, though they tend to be more creative and innovative.",
        "The last-born child typically has the least limits and, therefore, is more likely to take the riskiest options.",
        "A danger for last-borns is that they may be more likely to be disappointed in life. Last-borns are more likely to grow up with expectations that other people, specifically parental figures, would automatically know and prove what you wanted. However, the longer people are taken care of, the higher the chance they will feel let down by others later in life.",

        "While nuclear power plants themselves do not create carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, or nitrogen oxides, the mining, enrichment, and transportation of uranium generates harmful fossil fuel byproducts.",
        "Fossil fuels supply about 90% of the worlds electricity. These fuels emit dangerous gasses such as carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxide, which create acid rain and may contribute to global warming. Nuclear energy does not directly add harmful gases to the atmosphere, but nuclear plants are expensive to build and create radioactive materials.",
        "Globally, there are over 430 commercial nuclear power reactors in 31 countries.",

        "In the United States, radioactivity is often measured in rems. However, most countries currently use the sievert (Sv) to measure radioactivity. One sievert is equal to 100 rems. The nuclear waste from an entire reactor gives off about 10,000 rems per hour, even 10 years after it was first used in a nuclear plant. A human who is exposed to 500 rems at one time will die.",
        "Currently, nuclear waste in the United States is stored in cooling pools of water and in dry storage casks at nuclear power plants.

        "The most powerful nuclear device ever detonated by the United States (at 25 megatons) was Castle Bravo at the Bikini Atoll of the Marshall Islands on March 1, 1954. It was also the largest accidental radiological contamination caused by the U.S. It was about 1,000 times more powerful than each of the atomic bombs which were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during WWII. Castle Bravo was the fifth largest nuclear explosion in the world.",
        "The most powerful nuclear weapon ever detonated was Russias Tsar Bomba. It is also the single most physically powerful device ever created by man. The fireball reached nearly as high as the altitude of the release plan and was seen 620 miles from ground zero. The mushroom cloud was over 40 miles high and the base of the cloud was 25 miles wide.

        "J. Robert Oppenheimer, along with Enrico Fermi, is considered the father of the atomic bomb. After the Trinity test in the United States in 1945, Oppenheimer quoted a line from the Bhagavad Gita: Now, I am become death, the destroyer of the world.",
        "Some researchers have argued that even a limited nuclear war (a small-scale use of nuclear weapons) would lead to a global holocaust in slow motion because once even a small nuclear war started, other nations would follow over decades, resulting in a full-scale nuclear war.",
        "Just removing a persons outer clothing can remove 90% of the radioactive material after a disaster.",
        "After Japans nuclear disaster in 2011, several countries have rethought the use of nuclear energy. For example, Germany plans to close all of its reactors by 2022. Italy and Switzerland have halted expanding their nuclear power. However, some big markets, such as China and India, are still pushing ahead with new nuclear plants.",
        "Before the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011, the International Energy Agency predicted that nuclear plants would add 360 gigawatts of generating capacity by 2035. After Fukushima, the IEA halved those estimates.",

He claims that radiation leaks from the plant were hundreds if not thousands of times higher than the government or industry ever acknowledged.",
        "A nuclear war would kill approximately 1 billion people, and hundreds of millions would be injured. The 3-4 billion people left alive would find themselves facing widespread radioactive contamination, a possible nuclear winter, increased levels of damaging ultraviolet rays due to partial destruction of the ozone layer, a global photochemical smog, as well as a multitude of toxic pollutants.",
        "Between 1945 and 1996, over 2,000 nuclear tests were carried out globally. Between 1945 and 1992, the U.S. held over 1,032 tests. Between 1949 and 1990, the Soviet Union carried out 715 tests. Additionally, between 1952 and 1991, the UK carried out 45 tests. France carried out 210 tests between 1960 and 1996.

        "Hours before the Indian Ocean tsunami, people reported seeing elephants\nand flamingos heading for higher ground. Dogs and zoo animals refused to\nleave their shelters. After the tsunami, very few dead animals were found.",
        "As a tsunami wave approaches shallow water near land, it slows down to about\n20-30 miles (30-50 km) per hour. As it slows, all the water that had been\ntraveling so fast pulls up, causing the wave to grow higher and higher. By\nthe time it hits shore, a tsunami wave can reach 100 feet high, or as tall\nas a 10-story building.",
        "Tsunamis were sometimes called tidal waves, but this is misleading because\ntsunamis have nothing to do with tides.",

        "Autumn has been called the hectic beauty of death.",
        "Levels of testosterone in both men and women are at their highest in the fall. Scientists speculate the surge may be a result of ancient mating instincts (e.g., the fall rutting season) or that decreasing daylight somehow triggers it.",
        "Since ancient times, autumn has ranked as one of the most important times of year as daylight begins to fade and cold, dark days lie ahead. Because a good harvest is necessary for survival, many societies tried to ensure a good harvest by honoring various gods and goddesses. Some societies, such as the Aztecs in ancient Mexico, even made human sacrifices to please the gods.",
        "Autumn babies, or those born between September and November, are more likely to live to 100 than those who were born in other times of the year.",
        "According to NASA, autumn is aurora season because geomagnetic storms are about twice as frequent as the annual average during the fall.",
        "A study in the journal Perception noted that men think women are more attractive in the cooler season. One theory is that mens testosterone levels rise during the fall. Another theory is the contrast effect. During the summer, men are frequently exposed to scantily clad womenbut not so much in the autumn, which shifts attractiveness criteria in womens favor in the fall.",
        "Scientists believe males evolved to be sexually primed by food, which made autumns harvest time an ideal time to find a mate and reproduce. In fact, studies show that a mix of pumpkin pie and donuts increased penile flow by 20%. A pumpkin pie-lavender mix increased the penile blood flow by 40%.",
        "A Harvest Moon is the full moon closest to the autumn equinox. Before artificial lighting, such moonlight was essential to a farmers successful harvest.",
        "During the fall, in response to colder temperatures and less light, leaves stop producing chlorophyll, the green pigment that helps capture sunlight to power photosynthesis. As the green fades, the leaves other pigments shine through, such as orange and yellow carotenoids and vibrant red anthocyanin.",
        "Scientists believe global warming could affect autumn colors. As the world warms, leaves may delay changing their colors. Additionally, trees may not use their sugars to create red pigments; rather, they might send that fuel to growing new twigs. Global warming may also alter the habitats of trees, such as the sugar maple, which creates some of the most vibrant fall colors.",
        "Animals and plants respond to the light changes associated with autumn. For example, each autumn, the male Siberian hamsters testes swell up to 17 times bigger than normal to prepare for mating.",

        "Researchers found that during the cooler months of autumn, men are more likely to cozy up with their sweethearts and watch romantic comedies. Feeling cold activates a yearning for warmth and comfort with others.",
        "The autumnal equinox occurs on different dates each year, but usually falls on September 22 or 23. In 1931, the equinox fell on September 24 because the Gregorian calendar doesnt always match up with the position of Earth in its orbit around the sun. The fall equinox wont happen again on September 24 until 2303.",
        "The term equinox is from the Latin meaning equal night.",
        "Solstices and equinoxes are solar events that have to do with Earths position in relation to the sun at different times of the year. Solstices (summer and winter) are when the sun is at its northernmost or southernmost position in the sky. The equinox (fall and spring) is when day and night are (roughly) the same length all over the world.",

        "Each autumn, many animals experience gonadal recrudescence, or behavior in response to environmental cues (e.g., daylight). Specifically, in early fall, the amount of available daylight, or photoperiod, matches the photoperiod in spring, which triggers mating instincts in animals. The autumn photoperiod doesnt last long, as the days continue to shorten.",
        "During the spring and summer, most people eat more carbs. However, they develop a tendency for fattier foods in the autumn, which leads to seasonal weight gain.",
        "Research suggests that low levels of vitamin D (the sunshine vitamin) can lead to weight gain during autumn and winter. Lack of vitamin D reduces fat breakdown and triggers fat storage.",
        "Autumnal depression or seasonal affective disorder (SAD) affects between 4-5% of the population, although 10-20% have one any kind of symptoms related to it. It generally affects more women than men.",
        "Swedish researchers found that women lose more hair in the fall. The pattern is thought to be a result of evolution: women hold on to their hair during the summer to protect the scalp against the midday sun. Additionally, hair cells are the second fastest-growing cells in the body (after bone marrow) and are sensitive to environmental disruptions, such as seasonal changes.",

        "Hurricanes never form at the equator because they need the Coriolis Force, which is very weak at the equator, to spin.",
        "Although hurricanes can cause terrible damage, they are an important part of Earths complicated weather system. Like giant fans, they take hot air from the tropics and move it toward the poles. They help balance temperatures and moisture around the Earth. Without hurricanes and other storms, vast areas of the planet would be too hot for animal and human life.",

Previously, hurricanes were named either according to their longitude and latitude or were identified by the phonetic alphabet (Able, Baker, Charlie, etc.). In 1979, meteorologists added mens names to alternate with womens names. The first three male names ever used for hurricanes (Bob, David, and Frederick) all are retired.",
        "Hurricanes spin around a low-pressure center called the eye. Sinking air makes this 20- to 30-mile-wide area calm and free of clouds. A thick ring of clouds called the eye wall surrounds the eye and is the strongest part of the hurricane.",

There were also barrel makers, caulkers, and carpenters to fix the ships, as well as a surgeon.",

        "Columbus was not interested in proving the Earth was round. By Columbus time, most people knew this fact thanks to the ancient Greeksspecifically the Greek mathematician Pythagoras, who lived in the 6th century B.C., and later Aristotle, who backed him up with astronomical observations.",
        "Three countries refused to fund Columbus voyage: Portugal, England, and France. They refused because they thought he was a crackpot. They told him the Earth was much larger than he had calculated. They were actually right.",

        "Not all of Columbus voyages were successful; in fact, half of them ended in disaster. On his first voyage (1492), his fully outfitted flagship ran aground and sank. On his fourth trip, his ship rotted away and he spent a year with his men marooned on Jamaica.",
        "A section from Columbus logbook notes that the natives would make fine servants. With 50 men we could subjugate them and make them do whatever we want. He later wrote, Let us in the name of the Holy Trinity go on sending all the slaves that can be sold.",
        "While Columbus was not the first to discover America or the first European to visit the New World (Viking explorers had sailed to Greenland and Newfoundland in the 11th century), he did kick off centuries of exploration and exploitation of the American continents.",
        "One reason Columbus estimated the distance around the Earth shorter than other navigators is that he had read Arab maps. As he read the maps, he used a shorter distance for a mile than the Arab map makers had used, causing him to estimate the circumference as being one-fourth less than the actual number of miles. Additionally, Marco Polos book, which Columbus relied on, estimated China as much larger than it really was, which also shrank the distance from Europe to Asia.",

        "By tradition, it is generally supposed that Shakespeare was born on April\n23, 1564. April 23 is Saint George's Day, the national day of England, and\nthe same date as Shakespeare's death in 1616 at the age of 52.",
        "Shakespeare was born under the old Julian calendar, not the current Gregorian\ncalendar that was created in 1582 and adopted in England in 1751. What was\nApril 23 during Shakespeare's life would be May 3 on today's calendar.",

        "Because Anne Hathaway Shakespeare's tombstone states she was 67 when she\ndied in 1623, it is generally believed that she was eight years older than\nher husband. However, the figures 1 and 7 are easily confused--so she might\nhave been 61, only two years older than William.",

        "King Lear survives in two copies. The quarto edition includes\n300 lines and a whole scene that do not appear in the First Folio. The two\nversions give important speeches to different characters, altering the nature\nof three key characters. The endings are also significantly different.",

Sometimes called      spear-shaker, de\nVere died in 1604, before many of Shakespeare's plays were produced. Because\nde Vere led a rival theater company, scholars who support Shakespeare's authorship\nconsider it unlikely that de Vere would have given his best work to the Lord\nChamberlain's Men and the King's Men.",

For example, the British National War Savings Committee used the swastika as an emblem in WWI. The Boy Scouts also used the swastika as an emblem. Additionally, the Native American basketball team in 1909 featured the swastika on their basketball uniforms. The term swastika comes from the Sanskrit su good + asti to be, which means good luck.",
        "When he turned 50 on April 20, 1939, Hitler told his generals that he wanted to fight a war soon, while he was still strong. Less than five months later, on September 1, he invaded Poland and WWII began. FDR was 57, and Churchill was 65.",
        "Hitler once ordered a team of phrenologists to take measurements of his skull. They concluded that his skull was just like Napoleons and they had seen nothing like it since Frederick the Great.

        "The most deadly human parasites are protozoa, which are single-celled organisms. Some of these tiny creatures (there are over 80,000) have brought humans more misery and death than anything else in history, including wars and famine. The most well known deadly parasitic protozoa is plasmodium, which causes malaria.",

        "A person cannot starve a tapeworm, but they may try to eat foods that tapeworms dislike such as garlic and onions. It may be unpleasant, though, to feel and then see, several feet of squirming tapeworms pass from the body. Doctors can also treat tapeworms with drugs. However, if the scolex (head) and neck of the worm are not destroyed, the parasite will regrow itself.",

Researchers believe this common worm may be responsible for the high rates of HIV infections in women in Africa because of the worms behavior in the female body. When women do laundry in the waterways, the worm makes it way up the vaginal canal and creates small sores inside, which open the way for HIV infection. The parasite infection can be cured with a pill that costs 8 cents.k\n\n\n\n\n3 Main Types of Parasites d\n\n\nParasite\nDescription\n\n\nEctoparasites\nLive on the outside of their host, either in or on the skin.

        "Two strains of HIV have been identified: HIV-1 (from the Central Common Chimpanzee) and HIV-2 (from the Sooty Mangabey monkey). HIV-1 is more virulent, more easily transmitted, and is the cause of the vast majority of global HIV infections. HIV-2 is harder to transmit and is mainly confined to West Africa.",
        "The most simple and plausible theory as to how HIV was transmitted from monkeys to humans is called the Hunter Theory, or Bush Meat Theory. In this scenario, the virus was transmitted in the 1930s from an ape or monkey to a human in Africa when a hunter or bush meat handler was bitten or cut while hunting or butchering an animal. HIV was then transmitted among humans for decades in Africa, mostly via unprotected heterosexual vaginal sex.",
        "HIV initially spread in each country a little differently. For example, in Ukraine, drug users were the first to be affected. In the U.S. and U.K., the virus spread through homosexual and bisexual relations, while in sub-Sahara Africa, it spread through heterosexual relations.",

        "The ability for the transmission of the HIV virus from animal to human required high-risk transmission channels. Scientists cite the emergence of colonialism and the growth of large colonial African cities. This growth led to a higher degree of sexual promiscuity, the spread of prostitution, and the spread of genital ulcer diseases such as syphilis.",

        "The National Osteoporosis Foundation estimates that about 24% of the approximately 300,000 people who fracture a hip each year die within one year. Many others suffer serious depression and withdraw from society because they are so afraid of breaking bones. Hip fractures are one of the most serious consequences of osteoporosis.",
        "The United States has one of the highest rates of osteoporosis in the world. Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, and certain parts of South Africa have historically had very low rates of osteoporosis.",
        "A 2004 report on bone health issued by the United States Surgeon General revealed that 9 out of 10 teenaged girls in the U.S. fail to get enough calcium.",
        "Ancient skeletons and mummies reveal that osteoporosis has existed for thousands of years.",
        "Osteoporosis was formally recognized as a disease in the 1800s, when English surgeon Astley Cooper (1768-1841) described it and noted that it usually affected older people.",
        "In 1820, French physician Jean Lobstein (1777-1835) named the disease osteoporosis because patients bones had larger than normal holes or pores. The term osteoporosis is from the Greek osteon, meaning bone, and poros, meaning passage or space.",
        "Bone mass doubles between birth and age two, doubles again by age 10, and doubles yet again during puberty. It continues to increase until about age 30, when the maximum or peak bone mass is attained. After that, more bone tissue is lost than is replaced during bone remodeling, resulting in a 5-10% loss of bone mass per decade of life.",
        "The combination of collagen and minerals makes bone one of the strongest and most flexible natural materials on earth. One cubic inch of bone can withstand loads of up to 20,000 pounds, over four times the strength of concrete.",
        "Because osteoporosis has no warning signs, medical experts call it a silent disease. Often the first symptom of osteoporosis is a broken bone from little or no trauma.",
        "Spinal fractures due to osteoporosis often result from minimal trauma such as coughing, sneezing, or slightly bending the body. A person may be unaware that a spinal fracture has occurred until multiple broken vertebra lead to pain, a permanent loss of height, or a hump on the back known as kyphosis or dowagers hump. Kyphosis can lead to neck and back pain, reduced lung function (due to the lungs being unable to fill with air), a protruding abdomen, and poor balance.",
        "Spinal fractures are the most common type of bone breakage to result from osteoporosis. In the U.S alone, there are more than 550,00 such fractures each year.",
        "The National Osteoporosis Foundation estimates that osteoporosis is responsible for more than 2 million fractures each year.",
        "Research suggests that soft drinks, particularly those that contain phosphoric acid, increase the risk of osteoporosis.",
        "Aside from spinal fractures, the most common osteoporosis bone breaks are in the wrist and hip. About 400,000 osteoporosis-related wrist fractures occur in the U.S. each year. The most common type of wrist fracture in people with osteoporosis is a Colles fracture, when the radius breaks and the wrist joint is displaced backwards.",
        "More women than men fracture a hip from osteoporosis, but men with hip fractures are nearly twice as likely to die in the year after the breakage occurs. Researchers believe this is because men tend to sustain hip fractures at an older age than women do, and being older increases the risk of death. Men with hip fractures are also more likely to develop fatal infections.",
        "Breaking a bone due to osteoporosis is different than bone breaks in those who do not have the disease. Scientists note that osteoporotic bones often heal more slowly and less completely than normal bones, probably because they contain fewer bone minerals and other materials essential for healing.",
        "Bones are in a constant state of remodeling; in other words, old bone is broken down and replaced with new bone. Osteoporosis occurs due to loss of both a mineral and protein matrix, making bones extremely fragile.",
        "Women are more likely to develop osteoporosis because they typically have less bone mass to start with than men do. Women undergoing menopause also experience a sudden loss of estrogen, a sex hormone that helps build and maintain healthy bones.",
        "The Surgeon Generals office stated that by the year 2020, half of all Americans older than age 50 would be at risk for fractures from osteoporosis. Of women now age 50 or older, 40% will suffer a fracture of the hip, wrist, or spine at some point in their lives.",
        "Osteoporosis can be suggested by X-rays and confirmed by tests that measure bone density.",
        "Osteoporosis is treated by prescription medications, stopping the use of alcohol and cigarettes, adequate exercise, calcium, and vitamin D.",
        "Osteoporosis fractures cost around $18 billion per year, or $38 million a day. In 2005, fractures related to osteoporosis were responsible for an estimated $19 billion. By 2025, experts predict it will rise to $25.3 billion.",
        "A womans risk of hip fractures is equal to her risk of developing breast, uterine, and ovarian cancer combined.",
        "There are many situations that can increase a persons risk for osteoporosis, including a chronic illness such as liver or kidney disease, chronic use of corticosteroids such as prednisone, difficulty absorbing nutrients due to stomach or intestinal problems, estrogen or testosterone deficiencies, excessive use of tobacco or alcohol, low body weight, anorexia nervosa, lack of exercise, some medications, long periods of immobilization, poor nutrition, low vitamin D, high caffeine intake, inflammation, and chronic stress.",
        "Risk factors for developing osteoporosis include gender (women are more likely to develop the disease), age, body size (small, thin women are at greater risk), ethnicity (white and Asian women are at the highest risk, black and Hispanic women have the lowest risk), and family history.",
        "Studies show that adolescent boys who intake less than 1,000 milligrams of calcium daily and girls who intake less than 850 milligrams daily wont achieve their optimal bone mass.",

        "Studies show that if an adult person weighs less than 127 pounds at any height, he or she is more likely to develop osteoporosis.",
        "Women with a history of anorexia nervosa or bulimia are at a high risk for developing osteoporosis and may be two to three times as prone to bone fractures. Their risk may last throughout their lifetime, especially if peak bone mass was affected.",
        "Young women who diet and exercise excessively may also develop amenorrhea and an estrogen deficiency. In extreme cases, young women can develop osteoporosis and fractures.",
        "A body mass index of 20 or less is associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis. Women who are overweight have a lower risk of osteoporosis because fat cells produce estrogen. However, being overweight is associated with many other risk factors.",
        "The age when a female had her first period and the age when she had her last period are both contributors to her risk of osteoporosis. Estrogen rises during the menstrual cycle, and estrogen helps protect bones. Those who started their periods earlier and stopped later received more bone-building estrogen over the years.",
        "By age 80, smokers have bone density 6% to 10% lower than nonsmokers.",
        "One study shows that postmenopausal women who drank 16 drinks a week had a 5% to 10% higher bone mass density (BMD) than postmenopausal women who drank less than two drinks per week. The increase in bone density may be because alcohol can help convert testosterone to estrogen after menopause. Alcohol may also increase calcitonin, a hormone that inhibits bone reabsorption, in menopausal women.",
        "Excessive drinking, especially during adolescence and young adulthood, can decrease bone growth and increase the risk of osteoporosis for both men and women.",
        "Studies show that bariatric surgery can raise the risk of osteoporosis.",
        "Astronauts are at risk for developing osteoporosis because of their prolonged weightlessness. Gravity is essential for strong bones.",
        "Anorexics typically have a high level of the glucocorticoid called cortisol, which contributes to bone loss and increases the likelihood of developing osteoporosis.",
        "Teens with anorexia have been found to have spinal density 25% less than that of healthy teens.",
        "The bone mass a person builds by their mid 20s and 30s is the best theyll ever have. A person cannot build any more. The amount of bone gained during adolescence should equal the amount lost during the rest of your adult life.",
        "Calcium is only one of the minerals responsible for maintaining bones, but as many as 35% of Americans are deficient.",
        "Children between the ages of 9 and 18 need the most calcium (1,300 mg) per day. For postmenopausal women, the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) is 1,200 mg per day. Most physicians recommend 1,500 mg of calcium daily for someone who has been diagnosed with osteoporosis.",
        "The most effective way to prevent osteoporosis is to eat a diet rich in vitamin D and calcium, exercise, and do not smoke or drink in excess.",
        "Osteoporotic bones are not painful. The only time a person will have pain with osteoporosis is after a fracture.",
        "Osteoporosis is more common in developed countries than in developing ones, among city dwellers than country dwellers and, surprisingly, in countries where the diet contains a significant proportion of milk, cheese, and other dairy products than in countries where the consumption of dairy products is small or nonexistent.",
        "Osteoporosis is the most common and potentially the most debilitating bone disease known to man and woman.",
        "One half of women over 50 will fracture a bone because of osteoporosis.",
        "Bone loss in women is most severe in the first 5 to 6 years after menopause. On average, women go through natural menopause at 51 years and 4 months of age. Surgical menopause is the result of having a hysterectomy with a bilateral oophorectomy (the surgical removal of the uterus and both ovaries). About 590,000 hysterectomies are performed in civilian hospitals in the U.S. each year.",
        "Osteoporosis is the 4th leading cause of death of women, following heart disease, cancer, and stroke. Death from osteoporosis is usually a result of complications that may follow bone fractures.",
        "Women are at a greater risk of developing osteoporosis than men because 1) women often have less bone mass to begin with than men do and 2) men do not experience the usually complete loss of hormones that women do when they undergo menopause.",
        "Scientists believe that there is a correlation between the high sugar level in the blood of diabetics and osteoporosis. Long-term uncontrolled diabetes may lead to a significantly higher rate of osteoporosis in both female and male diabetics.",
        "Creaking joints are not a symptom of bone loss. Osteoporosis is not a joint disease.",

The three most common disorders are anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder. Anorexia nervosa is characterized by self-starvation, weight loss, an irrational fear of gaining weight, and a distorted body image. Bulima nervosa is characterized by a cycle of compulsive binging followed by purging through various means, such as vomiting, laxative/diuretic abuse, and extreme exercising. Binge eating disorder is the most common disorder and is characterized by frequent periods of compulsive overeating without accompanying purging behaviors.",
        "Nearly 10 million females and 1 million males have a form of anorexia or bulimia in the United States. Millions more are struggling with compulsive eating disorder. Additionally, over 70 million people worldwide struggle with an eating disorder.",

        "Bulimics who use laxatives believe they can prevent their bodies from absorbing food by fast elimination. However, nutrients are absorbed in the small intestine, and laxatives work mainly in the large bowel. The only weight a person loses with a laxative is water. Bulimics often overuse laxatives, which can lead to inflammation of the intestinal lining, damage to the colon, severe dehydration, and decreased levels of potassium and sodium. Ironically, overuse of laxatives can also cause constipation.",

        "French Second Lieutenant Alfred Joubaire wrote in his diary about WWI just before he died that Humanity is mad! It must be mad to do what it is doing. What a massacre. What scenes of horror and carnage! I cannot find words to translate my impressions. Hell cannot be so terrible! Men are mad!",
        "Some Americans disagreed with the United States initial refusal to enter WWI and so they joined the French Foreign Legion or the British or Canadian army.

        "In early 1917, British cryptographers deciphered a telegram from German Foreign Secretary Arthur Zimmermann to Germany's minister in Mexico. The telegraph encouraged Mexico to invade U.S. territory. The British kept it a secret from the U.S. for more than a month. They wanted to show it to the U.S. at the right time to help draw the U.S into the war on their side.",
        "Woodrow Wilsons campaign slogan for his second term was He kept us out of war. About a month after he took office, the United States declared war on Germany on April 6th 1917.",
        "To increase the size of the U.S. Army during WWI, Congress passed the Selective Service Act, which was also known as the conscription or draft, in May 1917. By the end of the war, 2.7 million men were drafted. Another 1.3 million volunteered.",

        "Herbert Hoover, who would become president in 1929, was appointed U.S. Food Administrator. His job was to provide food to the U.S. army and its allies. He encouraged people to plant Victory Gardens, or personal gardens. More than 20 million Americans planted their own gardens, and food consumption in the U.S decreased by 15%.",
        "The total cost of WWI for the U.S. was more than $30 billion.",
        "The term dogfight originated during WWI. The pilot had to turn off the planes engine from time to time so it would not stall when the plane turned quickly in the air. When a pilot restarted his engine midair, it sounded like dogs barking.",

        "Four empires collapsed after WWI: Ottoman, Austro-Hungarian, German, and Russian.",
        "While the first military submarine (named the Turtle) was first used by the Continental Army during the American Revolution, submarines only made a large military impact during WWI when Germany launched its fleet of U-boats. Its submarines mostly stayed on the surface and submerged only to attack ships with torpedoes. Germanys indiscriminate submarine warfare was a primary reason the U.S. joined the war.",
        "World War I was also known as the Great War, the World War, the War of the Nations, and the War to End All Wars.",
        "WWI was fought from 1914-1918 on every ocean and on almost every continent. Most of the fighting, however, took place in Europe.",
        "WWI began on June 28, 1914, when a Serbian terrorist shot and killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, and his wife. Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia on July 28, 1914. Russia and France sided with Serbia, and Germany supported Austria-Hungary.

        "The trench network of World War I stretched approximately 25,000 miles (40,200 km) from the English Channel to Switzerland. The area was known as the Western Front. British poet Siegfried Sassoon wrote, When all is done and said, the war was mainly a matter of holes and ditches.",
        "For the span of WWI, from 1914-1918, 274 German U-boats sank 6,596 ships. The five most successful U-boats were U-35 (sank 224 ships), U-39 (154 ships), U-38 (137 ships), U-34 (121 ships), and U-33 (84 ships). Most of these were sunk near the coast, particularly in the English Channel.",

        "France, not Germany, was the first country to use gas against enemy troops in WWI. In August 1914, they fired the first tear gas grenades (xylyl bromide) against the Germans. In January 1915, Germany first used tear gas against Russian armies, but the gas turned to liquid in the cold air. In April 1915, the Germans were the first to use poisonous chlorine gas.",
        "During WWI, the Germans released about 68,000 tons of gas, and the British and French released 51,000 tons. In total, 1,200,000 soldiers on both sides were gassed, of which 91,198 died horrible deaths.",
        "Approximately 30 different poisonous gases were used during WWI. Soldiers were told to hold a urine-soaked cloth over their faces in an emergency. By 1918, gas masks with filter respirators usually provided effective protection. At the end of the war, many countries signed treaties outlawing chemical weapons.",
        "During the war, the U.S. shipped about 7.5 million tons of supplies to France to support the Allied effort. That included 70,000 horses or mules as well as nearly 50,000 trucks, 27,000 freight cars, and 1,800 locomotives.",
        "WWI introduced the widespread use of the machine gun, a weapon Hiram Maxim patented in the U.S. in 1884. The Maxim weighed about 100 pounds and was water cooled. It could fire about 450-600 rounds per minute. Most machine guns used in WWI were based on the Maxim design.",

In 1979, the U.S. Army finally gave war medals and veteran benefits to the few Hello Girls who were still alive.",
        "During WWI, American hamburgers (named after the German city of Hamburg) were renamed Salisbury steak. Frankfurters, which were named after Frankfurt, Germany, were called liberty sausages,\" and dachshunds became liberty dogs. Schools stopped teaching German, and German-language books were burned.",
        "Millions of soldiers suffered shell shock, or posttraumatic stress disorder, due to the horrors of trench warfare. Shell-shocked men often had uncontrollable diarrhea, couldnt sleep, stopped speaking, whimpered for hours, and twitched uncontrollably. While some soldiers recovered, others suffered for the rest of their lives.",
        "Even though the U.S. government didnt grant Native Americans citizenship until 1924, nearly 13,000 of them served in WWI.",

        "The Germans were skilled at intercepting and solving Allied codes. Germans also captured one out of four paper messengers.

The eight Choctaw men and others who joined them became known as the Choctaw Code Talkers.",

        "Edith Cavell (1865- October 12 1915) was a British nurse who saved soldiers from all sides. When she helped 200 Allied soldiers escape from German-occupied Belgium, the Germans arrested her and she was executed by a German firing squad. Her death helped turn global opinion against Germany.",
        "The Harlem Hell Fighters were one of the few African American units that saw the front lines. For their extraordinary acts of heroism, the soldiers received the French Croix de Guerre, a medal awarded to soldiers from Allied countries for bravery in combat. However, in the U.S their deeds were largely ignored.",
        "The most decorated American of WWI was Alvin Cullum York (1887-1964). York led an attack on a German gun nest, taking 32 machine guns, killing 28 German soldiers, and capturing 132 more. He returned home with a Medal of Honor, a promotion to Sergeant, the French Croix de Guerre, and a gift of 400 acres of good farmland.",
        "U.S. troops fought their first battle of World War I on November 2, 1917, in the trenches at Barthelemont, France.",
        "The greatest single loss of life in the history of the British army occurred during the Battle of Somme, when the British suffered 60,000 casualties in one day. More British men were killed in that one WWI battle than the U.S. lost from all of its armed forces and the National Guard combined.",
        "WWI transformed the United Stated into the largest military power in the world.",
        "Although Germany may have forced the hand of the European powers in the summer of 1914, it did not cause war. Germany was not responsible for creating the atmosphere in which war was a probability. WWI broke out against a background of rivalry between the worlds great powers, including Britain, Germany, France, Russia, Austria-Hungry, Italy, the Ottoman Empire, and Japan. The previous 40 years were characterized by increasing nationalism, imperialism. militarism, and various alliances.",
        "The long-term effects of WWI include the formation of the League of Nations, which laid the groundwork for the United Nations and a worldwide arms race. Additionally, the Treaty of Versailles imposed severe sanctions on Germany, which drove the country into a deep recession, setting the groundwork for WWII.",
        "WWI helped strengthen the power of central government in the United States and Europe, which meant that 19th-century liberalism that emphasized individual responsibly was gone forever. In fact, one of the chief legacies of the war is the lasting power of the state over its citizens.",
        "WWI increased peoples suspicions of minority groups. All outsiders were considered a potential threat, especially the Jews, who were seen as sleek profiteers of the armaments industry.",
        "During WWI, the Turks slaughtered approximately 1.5 million Armenians. This act of genocide would later attract the attention of Hitler and was partly responsible for sowing the seeds of the Holocaust.",
        "After WWI, Britains leadership in the world economy was gone forever. It had huge debts, high unemployment, and slow growth. France suffered as well. Most of the loans it had made to czarist Russia were never repaid, inflation was rampant, and large parts of the country were ruined.",
        "WWI brought a new era of warfare. The most significant development was air power, which brought civilians in the line of fire. By 1918, it was clear that the days of cavalry as a realistic fighting force were over with the introduction of poisonous gas. Tanks heralded a new era of offensive war. Finally, the Nazi blitzkrieg tactic of WWII grew out of the final Allied offensive of 1918 in which tanks, aircraft, artillery, and men were carefully coordinated.",
        "Because mustard gas was unpredictable, it was never the war-winning weapon its users hoped it would be in WWI. Neither side used it in WWII.",
        "WWI helped bring about the emancipation of women. Women took over many traditionally male jobs and showed that they could perform them just as well as men. In 1918, most women over the age of 30 were given the vote in the British parliamentary elections. Two years later, the 19th amendment granted American women the vote.",
        "WWI helped bring about the emancipation of African Americans. For example, Henry Ford recruited black people from the South to work in his factories. The migration of African Americans from the South to the North during WWI was one of the most significant population shifts in the 20th century.",
        "WWI helped hasten medical advances. Physicians learned better wound management and the setting of bones. Harold Gillies, an English doctor, pioneered skin graft surgery. The huge scale of those who needed medical care in WWI helped teach physicians and nurses the advantages of specialization and professional management.",
        "Post-WWI literature includes T.S. Eliots The Waste Land (1923), Ernest Hemingways A Farewell to Arms, Erich Maria Remarques All Quiet on the Western Front, and Wilfred Owens tragic poem, Anthem for Doomed Youth.",
        "WWI was the catalyst that transformed Russia into the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republic (USSR). It was the creation of the worlds first communist state and ushered in a new phase in world history. Historians note that this was the most startling and important consequence of WWI.",
        "After WWI, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland emerged as independent nations.",
        "The collapse of the Ottoman Empire after WWI helped the Allies extend their influence into the Middle East. Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and Palestine were declared mandates under the League of Nations. France essentially took control of Syria and Britain took control over the remaining three mandates.",
        "The Treaty of Versailles stated that Germany had started WWI. It gave Alsace and Lorraine back to France. Poland picked up German territory in the east, and other territories were given to Belgium and Lithuania. The treaty also transferred the Hultschin area of Upper Silesia to Czechoslovakia. The eastern part of Upper Silesia was assigned to Poland. Lower Silesia, meanwhile, was left entirely to Germany. The key Baltic port of Danze, the industrial region of the Saar Basin, and the strategically important Rhineland were also taken from Germany. Its armed forces were strictly limited and its colonies were made League of Nations mandates. A 1921 Reparations Committee decided that Germany should pay $33 billion in compensation to the Allies for the damage it caused. The Treaty left Germany humiliated and impoverished, which left the world vulnerable to another world war.d\n\n\n\n10 Bloodiest Battles of World War I e\n\n\nBattle\nTotal Casualties\n\n\n1.

However, the final battle of the war was fought on January 8, 1815, after the Treaty had already been signed. President Madison finally signed his name on the Senate ratified treaty on February 16, 1815.",
        "On September 10, 1813, Oliver Hazard Perry led an American victory on Lake Erie. After the battle, he wrote his famous message to General William Henry Harrison:  We have met the enemy, and they are ours.",
        "There were several factors that led to the War of 1812: 1) Great Britain (and, to a lesser extent, France) was preventing U.S. trade with foreign countries, 2) Great Britain tried to prevent U.S. expansion westward, 3) Britain was arming the Native Americans with guns, 4) Britain was forcing U.S. sailors to serve on British Navy ships, 4) Britain thought America was interested in annexing Canada, and 5) Americans wanted to save their honor in face of British insults.",
        "During the War of 1812, 2,260 Americans were killed in action and 4,505 were wounded. Approximately 15,000 died from all causes directly related to the war (such as disease). Approximately 1,600 British were killed in action; 3,670 were wounded; and 3,321 died from disease. These numbers do not include Native American or Canadian militia fatalities",
        "U.S. sailors were more experienced and better trained than U.S. soldiers during the War of 1812. While U.S. soldiers generally had little experience and training, many sailors had fought against pirates in North Africa and some had been impressed and served aboard British naval ships.",

The resulting bitter feelings between Britain and the U.S. fueled tension that set the stage for war.",

        "The Star Spangled Banner was composed after Francis Scot Key saw that an American flag still stood over Fort McHenry after a night of fierce fighting during the Battle of Baltimore. The song became the national anthem in 1931. The flag, at 42 feet by 30 feet, was the largest in the nation at the time, and today it is on display in the National Museum of American History.",
        "The Star Spangled Banner was composed during the War of 1812. However, it was originally a poem called The Defense of Fort McHenry. After it was written, it was set to a popular melody written by English composer John Stafford Smith for the Anacreontic Society, a mens social club in London.",
        "Mary Pickersgill (1776-1857), along with her daughter and several other women, made the Star Spangled Banner Flag that was raised at Fort McHenry during the War of 1812. The flag was made from over 400 yards of fabric, displayed 15 stars and 15 stripes, and weighed 50 pounds. The flag took six weeks to make. It was originally 30 feet by 42 feet but now measures 30 feet by 34 feet because pieces of it, including one of its stars, were occasionally cut and given away as gifts.",
        "Although the British fired more than 1,500 cannonballs at Fort McHenry during the Battle of Baltimore, the fort suffered little damage. The British knew they had failed to take the fort and withdrew.",
        "During the War of 1812, some New England federalists considered seceding form the United States during a meeting called the Hartford Convention. The government of Massachusetts even sent a secret emissary to discuss a separate peace with the British.",
        "After British troops set fire to the White House, the Capitol and other federal buildings, the next day a huge storm and a rare tornado put the fires out. According to the National Weather Service, debris from the tornado killed more British soldiers than Americans did with their guns during their occupation of Washington, D.C.",

        "While the Treaty of Ghent placed America and Great Britain back to status quo ante bellum, or the state existing before the war, the Native Americans who sided with the British in the war to block American expansion were weakened and without the protection of a European power. Consequently, the War of 1812 created a prime opportunity of American expansion.",
        "At the beginning of the War of the 1812, the British had the largest navy in the world, with more than 600 ships. The United States had only 18 sailable ships.",

        "Some historians note that the charges of impressment of American seamen into the Royal Navy were exaggerated and that the real issue driving the United States to war was British support of Native Americans in conflicts with the U.S. This is what pushed Southern and Western senators, particularly the War Hawks Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun, toward war.",
        "The red glare in Francis Scott Keys Star Spangled Banner was from British missiles called Congreves that looked like giant bottle rockets. The bombs bursting in air were 200-pound cannonballs that were designed to explode above their target.",
        "The iconic Uncle Sam has its roots in the War of 1812. Sam Wilson, a military supplier in New York, labeled meat rations U.S, which supposedly stood for Uncle Sam Wilson, who was feeding the army. The image of Uncle Sam as a white-bearded figure, however, did not appear until WWI.",
        "The burning of the U.S. Capital in 1814 may have been advantageous for the U.S. in the long run. The Presidents House, as it was called, was rebuilt with sturdier, higher-quality material. The books that were burned were replaced by Thomas Jeffersons impressive 7,000-volume collection, which became the foundation of todays Library of Congress.",
        "In April 1813, American soldiers defeated British forces at York (present-day Toronto), the then-capital city of the Canadian land called Ontario.

        "Probably the most humiliating defeat for the United States occurred on August 16, 1812, when Sir Isaac Brock and his Native American ally Tecumseh tricked American William Hull into believing that they had more troops than they actually had. Hull surrendered Detroit without any shots fired. For his speedy surrender, he was sentenced to be shot, but he received a reprieve from President Madison.",

        "A crucial battle in the War of 1812 was the Battle of the Thames in 1813. After the British lost control of Lake Erie, British General Proctor and his ally Tecumseh retreated into Canada trailed by American General William Henry Harrison. Tecumseh convinced Proctor to turn and fight. However, Harrisons force defeated the British and Indian soldiers and killed Tecumseh, which spelled the end of the Native American dream of an Indian confederacy.",

        "While the British had far superior gun power and manpower at Lake Champlain, the Americans, led by Captain Thomas Macdonough, won the battle. With both ships damaged in battle, Macdonough spun his ship around 180 degreeswithout the help of the windso that the undamaged guns on the landside of the ship faced the enemy. He used the fresh guns to defeat the British. He had previously attached special lines to the anchor cables to help the spin the ship.",
        "Britains worst defeat during the War of 1812 happed at the Battle of New Orleans, after a peace treaty had already been signed. Andrew Jackson built an army from militiamen from Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Louisiana as well as pirates, free blacks, and Native Americans. Still outnumbered by the British 2 to 1, he built barriers from bales of cotton and earthwork. While 300 British were killed (including the commander), 1,250 wounded, and 500 captured, fewer than 15 Americans were killed.",
        "Both Britain and the U.S. decided to stop fighting because 1) neither side expected to win easily and 2) most of the reasons the war started (trade restrictions and impressment of U.S. soldiers) were an indirect result of the Napoleonic Wars, which Britain had won. After the defeat of Napoleon, the reasons for fighting essentially disappeared.",
        "Before the Treaty of Ghent was signed by President Madison on February 16, 1815, Britain insisted that America turn a large part of the Northwest Territory into an Indian reservation that would serve as a buffer between the U.S. and Canada. After the Battle of New Orleans, however, Britains bargaining position was weakened and could make no such demands.",
        "While the War of 1812 may seem to have been fought as a sideshow to Britains war with France, it did have several important consequences for the U.S., including a rise in U.S. manufacturing and the end of the Federalist Party. The U.S. also came out of the war with a sense of pride and nationalismthe U.S. had not lost to the mightiest nation in the world.

      "Holocaust": [
        "The Holocaust began in January 1933 when Hitler came to power and technically ended on May 8, 1945 (VE Day).",
        "Between 1933 and 1945, more than 11 million men, women, and children were murdered in the Holocaust. Approximately six million of these were Jews.",
        "Over 1.1 million children died during the Holocaust.",
        "Young children were particularly targeted by the Nazis to be murdered during the Holocaust. They posed a unique threat because if they lived, they would grow up to parent a new generation of Jews. Many children suffocated in the crowded cattle cars on the way to the camps. Those who survived were immediately taken to the gas chambers.",
        "The majority of people who were deported to labor and death camps were transported in cattle wagons. These wagons did not have water, food, a toilet, or ventilation. Sometimes there were not enough cars for a major transport, so victims waited at a switching yard, often with standing room only, for several days. The longest transport of the war took 18 days. When the transport doors were open, everyone was already dead.",
        "The most intensive Holocaust killing took place in September 1941 at the Babi Yar Ravine just outside of Kiev, Ukraine, where more than 33,000 Jews were killed in just two days. Jews were forced to undress and walk to the ravines edge. When German troops shot them, they fell into the abyss. The Nazis then pushed the wall of the ravine over, burying the dead and the living. Police grabbed children and threw them into the ravine as well.",
        "Carbon monoxide was originally used in gas chambers. Later, the insecticide Zyklon B was developed to kill inmates. Once the inmates were in the chamber, the doors were screwed shut and pellets of Zyklong B were dropped into vents in the side of the walls, releasing toxic gas. SS doctor Joann Kremmler reported that victims would scream and fight for their lives. Victims were found half-squatting in the standing room only chambers, with blood coming out their ears and foam out of their mouths.",
        "In 1946, two partners in a leading pest control company, Tesch and Stabenow (Testa), were tried before a British military court on charges of genocide. It was argued that the accused must have realized that the massive supply of Zyklon B they provided to concentration camps was far above the quantity required for delousing. They were convicted and hanged.",
        "Over one million people were murdered at the Auschwitz complex, more than at any other place. The Auschwitz complex included three large camps: Auschwitz, Birkenau, and Monowitz.",
        "Prisoners, mainly Jews, called Sonderkommando were forced to bury corpses or burn them in ovens. Because the Nazis did not want eyewitnesses, most Sonderkommandos were regularly gassed, and fewer than 20 of the several thousand survived. Some Sonderkommandos buried their testimony in jars before their deaths. Ironically, the Sonderkommandos were dependent on continued shipment of Jews to the concentration camps for staying alive.",
        "The Final Solution was constructed during the Wannsee Conference in January 1942. Fourteen high-ranking Nazis met in Wannsee, a suburb of Berlin, and presented a program to deport all Jews to Poland where the SS would kill them.",
        "Kristallnacht or Night of Broken Glass occurred throughout Germany and Austria on November 9, 1938, when the Nazis viciously attacked Jewish communities. The Nazis destroyed, looted, and burned over 1,000 synagogues and destroyed over 7,000 businesses. They also ruined Jewish hospitals, schools, cemeteries, and homes. When it was over, 96 Jews were dead and 30,000 arrested.",
        "In the initial stages of the destruction of European Jews, the Nazis forced Jews into ghettos and instigated a policy of planned, indirect annihilation by denying them the basic means of survival. In the Warsaw ghetto in Poland, the largest ghetto, about 1% of the population died each month.",
        "An estimated 1/3 of all Jewish people alive at that time were murdered in the Holocaust.",
        "In his memoirs, Rudolph Hess described the process of tricking the Jews into entering the gas chambers. To avoid panic, they were told they had to undress to be washed and disinfected. The Nazi guards used a Special Detachment Team (other Jewish prisoners) to help keep an air of calm and to assist those who were reluctant to undress. Children often cried, but after members of the Special Detachment team comforted them, they entered the gas chambers, playing or joking with one another, often still carrying their toys.",
        "The word Holocaust is from the Greek holo whole + kaustos burnt. It refers to an animal sacrifice in which the entire animal is burned. It is also known as the Shoah, which is Hebrew for destruction. The terms Shoah and Final Solution always refer to the Nazi extermination of the Jews and the Holocaust refers to the overall genocide caused by the Nazis, while the general term holocaust can refer to the mass killing of any group by any government.",
        "The term holocaust became a household word in America when in 1978 NBC television aired the miniseries titled Holocaust. However, Holocaust survivor and author Elie Wiesel called the miniseries, untrue and offensive. Wiesel objected to what he thought were historical inaccuracies, German and Jewish stereotypes,  too much drama and not enough documentary. He also argued that television was an inappropriate medium to portray the Holocaust.",
        "Approximately 220,000-500,000 Romanies (Gypsies) were killed during the Holocaust.",
        "Unlike other genocides in which victims are often able to escape death by converting to another religion, those of Jewish descent could be spared only if their grandparents had converted to Christianity before January 18, 1871 (the founding of the German Empire).",
        "Of the nine million Jews who lived in Europe before the Holocaust, an estimated 2/3 were murdered. Millions of others, including those who were disabled, political and religious opponents to Hitler, Romanies, Jehovahs Witnesses, and homosexuals, were also murdered.",
        "Those who survived Dr. Josef Mengeles experiments were almost always murdered and dissected. Many children were maimed or paralyzed and hundreds died. He was known by children as Onkel Mengele and would bring them candy and toys before personally killing them. He later died in a drowning accident in Brazil in 1979.",
        "Twins fascinated Nazi doctor Josef Mengele (known as the Angel of Death). According to one witness, he sewed together a set of twins named Guido and Ina, who were about 4 years old, from the back in an attempt to create Siamese twins. Their parents were able to get some morphine and kill them to end their suffering.",
        "Hitler introduced the Nuremberg Laws in 1935, which made it illegal for Germans to marry or have sex with Jews. It also deprived Jews of their German citizenship and most of their civil rights.",
        "The 1940 Nazi pseudo-documentary The Eternal Jew attempted to justify the extermination of Jews from Europe. The movie claimed that Jews were genetically destined to be wandering cultural parasites.",
        "On November 11, 1938, Germany enacted the Regulations Against Jews Possession of Weapons, which made it illegal for Jews to carry firearms or other weapons.",
        "Gas in the chambers during the Holocaust entered the lower layers of air first and then rose slowly toward the ceiling, which forced victims to trample one another in an attempt to breathe. Stronger victims were often found on top of the pile of bodies.",
        "Muselmann (German for Muslim) was slang for concentration camp victims who gave up any hope of survival. They would squat with their legs tucked in an Oriental fashion, with their shoulders curved and their head dropped and overcome by despair. Jewish writer and Holocaust survivor Primo Levi stated that if he could enclose all the evil of our time in one image, I would choose this image.",
        "Hitler was able to build a network of over 1,000 concentration camps in several ways. First, he established a legal basis for acts of brutal inhumanity by creating the Enabling Act, which allowed him to do whatever he wanted. Second, he used propaganda and media to dehumanize Jewish people and, finally, he used a system of brutality to terrorize the people into submission.",
        "Approximately 100,000 Jews died during death marches.",
        "The first concentration camp was Dachau. The first arrivals to Dachau were political opponents of Hitler who were placed there in protective custody, including communists, socialists, and political Catholics. Later, it was used as an extermination camp for Jews.",
        "The soldiers who patrolled and operated concentration camps were known as Totenkopfverbande, or Deaths Head detachments. They wore skull-and-crossbones insignias on their uniforms to reflect their namesake.",
        "As Jews fled Europe under Hitlers rule, representatives from 32 countries met in Evian, France, in 1938 to discuss the growing refugee crisis in Europe. Representatives from Great Britain said it had no room to accommodate Jewish refugees. The Australians said, We dont have a racial problem and we dont want to import one. Canada said of the Jews that none was too many. Holland and Demark offered temporary asylum, but only for a few refugees. Only the Dominican Republic offered to take 100,000 Jews, but their relief agencies were so overwhelmed that only a few Jews could take advantage of the offer. A German foreign officer wrote a letter essentially saying that, in light of such responses, the world could not blame them [the Nazis] for not wanting the Jews.",
        "Einsatzgruppen (task forces) were mobile killing vans, which were regular trucks with the exhaust pipes redirected into the cargo area. Jews were herded into these trucks, sometimes 90 at a time. The Einsatzgruppen killed over 1.2 million Jews.",
        "During the Holocaust, Nazi Germany became a genocide state, a government dedicated to the annihilation of the Jews. Every arm of the government played a role. Parish churches provided the birth records of the Jews. The Finance Ministry took Jewish wealth and property. Universities researched more efficient ways to murder. And government transportation bureaus paid for the trains that carried the Jews to their death.",
        "There were several types of concentration camps during the Holocaust, including transit camps, prisoner of war camps, and police detention camps. Six camps served as the main killing centers, all in Poland: Treblinka, Sobibor, Belzec, Chelmno, Auschwitz/Birkenau, and Majdanek. The last two were also slave labor camps.",
        "More than 870,000 Jews were killed at Treblinka with a staff of just 150 people. There were fewer than 100 known survivors of Treblinka.",
        "At Birkenau (Auschwitz II) alone over 1.1 million Jews were murdered in addition to 20,000 Poles, 19,000 Gypsies, and 12,000 Russian prisoners of war.",
        "At the entrance to each death camp, there was a process of Selektion or Selection. Pregnant women, small children, the sick or handicapped, and the elderly were immediately condemned to death.",
        "Concentration camp laborers were forced to run in front of SS officers to show that they still had strength. The SS officers directed the runners into one of two lines. One line went to the gas chambers. The other went back to the barracks. The runners did not know which line went where.",
        "During the Holocaust, the most respected German corporations used slave labor, including BMW, Daimler-Benz (Mercedes-Benz), Messerschmitt, and Krupp. Though they were not forced to use slaves, they nevertheless used them as good business practice. Additionally, I.G. Farben, a German chemical industry conglomerate, invested more than 700 million Reich marks (German dollars) to build a huge petrochemical plant at Auschwitz III, which was staffed by human slaves.",
        "Auschwitz was the largest and highly organized death camp in history. It was actually three camps: a concentration camp, a death camp, and a slave labor camp. It was 19 square miles, guarded by 6,000 men, and was located in the Polish town of Oswiecim. It was opened June 1940 and initially held 728 Polish prisoners. By 1945, more than 1.25 million people had been killed there and 100,000 worked as slave laborers.",
        "At Auschwitz, thousands of prisoners were sterilized using radiation. Additionally, children of African-German origin and the mentally or physically handicapped were surgically sterilized, often brutally.",
        "Signs on the entrance to the gas chambers read: Baths and disinfecting rooms. Other notices read: Cleanliness brings freedom! It took 20 minutes to kill everyone in the chamber. The chambers at Auschwitz/Birkenau could kill 6,000 people a day.",
        "When Soviet troops entered Birkenau on January 18, 1945, they found 358,000 mens suits, 837,000 women outfits, and 15,400 pounds of human hair packed into paper bags. The Nazis were saving them in warehouses for future use.",
        "The Nazis would process Holocaust victims hair into felt and thread. Hair was also used to make socks for submarine crews, ignition mechanisms in bombs, ropes and cords for ships, and stuffing for mattresses. Camp commanders were required to submit monthly reports on the amount of hair collected.",
        "British troops liberating Bergen-Belsen found that the Nazis had experimented using human skin for lampshades.",
        "Six million is the minimum number of Jews killed by the Nazis. Thousands of infants and babies were killed before their births could be recorded.",
        "The first instance of mass murder by gas under Hitlers rule occurred on November 15, 1939, at the Owinksi psychiatric hospital near Poznan. The 1,100 victims, including 78 children, were Polish mental patients, and the gas used was carbon monoxide.",
        "The first mass gassing of Jews took place in the Chelmno extermination camp.",
        "To further the faade of cleanliness, SS men dressed as doctors pretended to examine the victims before they were unknowingly gassed. The real purpose of the procedure was to mark victims who had gold teeth in their mouths so their corpses could be set aside after gassing.",
        "Joseph Goebbels (1897-1945) was the Nazi minister of propaganda and, prior to 1933, head of the Nazi organization in Berlin. He committed suicide along with his wife and six children in Berlin during the last week of the war.",
        "Heinrich Himmler was the Nazi leader more directly involved than any other officer during the Holocaust. He established Dachau, the first concentration camp in Germany, and the extermination camps in Eastern Europe. Himmler was captured by the British at the end of the war, but he committed suicide before he could be brought to trial.",
        "Those who deny the Holocaust argue that the Nazi concept of a Final Solution always meant only the emigration of the Jews, not their extermination. The Jews missing from Europe after 1945 are assumed to have resurfaced in the U.S., Israel, and elsewhere as illegal immigrants. For many deniers or revisionists, the Holocaust was invented by the Jews to serve their own financial and political ends.",
        "More than half of the Jewish victims of the Holocaust were women. Most women with small children were immediately sent to the gas chambers as children were nearly useless to the Nazis and the commotion that separating the women and children might have caused would have jeopardized the efficiency of the killing process. Women were also singled out for experiments in contraception and fertility. Additionally, mothers with babies and other children too young to control their crying had trouble finding hideouts during round-ups to avoid being sent to the camps.",
        "In one infamous concentration camp experiment, newborn babies were taken away from nursing mothers to see how long they could survive without feeding.",
        "After concentration camps were liberated, thousands of people who had been starved, beaten, and worked to exhaustion died within their first week of freedom. In Dachau, the daily death rate in the days following liberation was 200, and in Bergen-Belsen it was 300. Some Jews who were liberated from concentration camps died from overeating sweets and chocolate provided by friendly soldiers.",
        "Bergen-Belson was the first camp to be liberated by Western Allied officers on April 15, 1945. Originally designed to house 10,000 prisoners, by the last weeks of the war, it held 41,000.",
        "Adolf Eichmann (1906-62) was an SS officer who directed the implementation of the Final Solution. At the end of war, he escaped to South America, but in 1960, the Israeli secret service captured him in Argentina and secretly removed him to Israel. In 1961, he was tried and convicted of crimes against humanity. He was hanged in 1962.",
        "One observer in 1959 noticed that the dirt at the Treblinka concentration camp was not brown but gray. As he felt the dirt trickle through his fingers, he realized the earth was coarse and sharp and filled with the fragments of human bone.",
        "At Dachau, the Nazis researched ways to stop a bullet wound from bleeding out. They would administer chemicals such as polygala-10 to prisoners and then shoot various parts of their bodies. The prisoners usually died from their injuries within a few moments.",
        "Porrajmos is the Romany term for the Holocaust and means devouring.",
        "More than half a million people visit the site of the former concentration camp Auschwitz every year.",
        "Material published in 2001 alleged that IBM, the American computer company, had developed punch card technology to make selection of Holocaust victims more efficient. A Romany organization planned to sue IBM for its role. The case was later dropped.",
        "Between 1945 and 1985, approximately 5,000 convicted Nazi war criminals were executed and 10,000 were imprisoned.",
        "The Holocaust gave new urgency to the Jewish quest for a homeland in the Middle East. The Yishuv, or Jewish community in Palestine, stood ready to take them, but the British who governed the region restricted immigration to keep peace with the local Arabs. On November 29, 1947, Resolution 181 was enforced. It called for the partition of Palestine into two states, one Jewish and one Arab, and developed a plan for ending British rule.",
        "In August 1945, the Allied powers created the International War Crimes Tribunal, which included judges from the U.S., Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and France. Never before in history had the losers of a nation at war been held to answer for their crimes before an international court.",
        "After the Holocaust, the U.N. formed the Commission of Human Rights in June 1946. In December 1948, the Commission approved two historic agreements: the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.",
        "When an injured and dying former SS man asked Holocaust survivor Simon Wiesenthal for forgiveness for his role in wiping out the entire Jewish population in a small Ukrainian town, Wiesenthal answered with silence rather than forgiveness. Haunted by the experience, Wiesenthal asked religious leaders, human rights activists, and others to comment on his choice. He collected their response and his own essay in The Sunflower: On the Possibilities and Limits of Forgiveness, which is now a classic of Holocaust literature.",
        "Holocaust survivor Yehuda Bacon, who spent his early teens in concentration camps, recounted that he burst out laughing during the first funeral procession he saw after liberation. People are crazy, he said. For one person they make a casket and play solemn music? A few weeks ago I saw thousands of bodies piled up to be burnt like so much junk.",
        "After WWII, the Allies grappled with whether to hold only the Nazi leaders accountable for the Holocaust or the whole German nation.",

        "At some concentration camps, selected prisoners were used for medical experimentation, including exposing the body to various conditions such as high altitude, freezing temperatures, and extreme atmospheric pressure. Others underwent experiments with diseases such as hepatitis, tuberculosis, and malaria.",
        "While most Holocaust deniers, or revisionists, acknowledge that the Jews suffered during WWII, they disagree with the features that made the Holocaust a unique event in human history by denying that (1) the Holocaust was an efficient and organized program of genocide, (2) that six million Jews were murdered, and (3) that the Final Solution was a plan for the complete destruction of the Jews.",

        "Victims at some concentration camps were injected with the bacterium that produces gas gangrene so Nazi doctors could research the effectiveness of sulfanilamide in preventing infection and mortification. Several women prisoners died or were severely burned as a result of infections caused by the treatment of high doses of sulfanilamide.",
        "Many Jewish children who were hidden in Christian families during the Holocaust were unaware of their Jewish heritage and remained with their foster parents.

      "Black Death": [
        "A plague epidemic swept through Europe from 1348 through 1351, killing an\nestimated 2560% of Europeans. Some estimates are as high as 2/3\nof the population.",
        "The exact death toll is difficult to measure from medieval sources. The number of deaths varied considerably by area and depending on the source. Current estimates are that between 75 and 200 million people died from the plague.",
        "The term \"Black Death\" is recent. During the plague, it was called \"the\nGreat Mortality\" or \"the Pestilence.\"",
        "Although the period known as the Black Death ended in 1351, the plague continued\nto return to Europe, with epidemics every few years through the end of the\nfifteenth century.",
        "The Black Death was the second plague pandemic of the Middle Ages. Justinians\nPlague in the sixth century was deadly and widespread, but did not create the\nsame devastation as the second pandemic.",
        "The Black Death followed a period of population growth in Europe which, combined\nwith two years of cold weather and torrential rains that wiped out grain crops,\nresulted in a shortage of food for humans and rats. This caused people and\nanimals to crowd in cities, providing an optimal environment for disease.",
        "In 1346, rumors of a plague that started in China and spread throughout Asia,\nPersia, Syria, Egypt, and India reached Europe. All of India was rumored to\nhave been depopulated.",
        "The first named victims of the plague died in 1338 and 1339 in the area around\nLake Issyk Kul (Lake Baikal) in Russia, where a grave marker says, \"In\nthe year of the hare (1339). This is the grave of Kutluk. He died of the plague\nwith his wife, Magnu-Kelka.\"",
        "During a siege of the Genoese city of Kaffa by the Tatars in 1347,\nthe inhabitants were reportedly infected with the plague when the Tatars\nthrew the bodies of plague victims into the city.",
        "In November 1347, a fleet of Genoese trading ships landed in Messina, Sicily\nafter trading along the coast from the Black Sea to Italy. The ships carried\ndead and dying sailors, many of whom had strange black growths on their necks,\nin their armpits, or in their groins. Many coughed blood. Those who were alive\ndied within days.",
        "From Sicily, the disease took three years to sweep through Europe, moving\nnorth and traveling as far as Iceland and Greenland. The plague and simultaneous\nclimate changes put an end to the European colonies on the coast of Greenland.",
        "In Siena, more than half the population died. Work stopped on the citys\ngreat cathedral, planned to be the biggest in the world, and was never resumed.\nThe truncated transept still stands as reminder of the death that halted construction.",
        "In May 1349, the plague reached Bergen, Norway, on a ship carrying wool from\nEngland. Within days of arriving in Bergen, the crew and passengers of the\nship had all died.",
        "Most experts agree that the plague was  caused by Yersinia pestis (or Y.\npestis), a bacillus carried by fleas that live primarily on rats and\nother rodents that were common in medieval dwellings.",
        "Since the 1980s, several researchers have blamed other diseases, including\nanthrax and typhus, for the plague. The argument claims that other diseases\nspread more easily between people without the required flea vector and can\ndisplay similar symptoms.",
        "A November 2000 study of tooth pulp in a French plague grave showed the presence\nof Y. pestis in all of 20 samples from three victims.",
        "Y. Pestis infects its flea by blocking its stomach. The flea tries\nrepeatedly to feed, but the blockage causes it to regurgitate bacilli\ninto its host. When the host dies, the flea and its offspring seek a new host,\ninfesting humans when necessary.",
        "Y. pestis causes three varieties of plague: bubonic plague, caused\nby bites from infected fleas, in which the bacteria moves to lymph nodes and\nquickly multiplies, forming growths, or buboes; pneumonic plague, a lung infection\nthat causes its victim to cough blood and spread the bacteria from person to\nperson; and septicemic plague, a blood infection that is almost always fatal.",
        "The mortality rate for humans who caught the bubonic plague was 30-75%. The\npneumonic plague killed 90-95% of its victims. The septicemic plague killed\nnearly 100% of the people it infected and still has no cure to this day.",
        "Medieval doctors believed the plague had at least one of several causes.\nMany thought it was a punishment from God for the sins of the people.",
        "Many also believed the plague was caused by pockets of bad air released by\nearthquakes or by an unfavorable alignment of Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars in\nthe 40th degree of Aquarius on March 20, 1345.",
        "Virtually nobody suspected the ever-present rats and fleas.",
        "The Jews were often accused of causing the plague to destroy Christiansf, even though Jews and Muslims were as likely to be infected as Christians.",
        "After being tortured, some Jews confessed that they were poisoning wells\nand other water sources, creating the plague. As a result, Jews were expelled\nor killed by the thousands.",
        "As a result of forced confessions, the entire Jewish population of Strassburg,\nGermany, was given the choice to convert to Christianity or be burned on rows\nof stakes on a platform in the citys burial ground. About 2,000 were\nkilled.",
        "Many doctors believed that bad smells could drive out the plague. As a result,\nsome of the treatment for the disease included dung and urine, as well as other\ningredients that were more likely to spread disease than to cure it.",
        "Other ways purported to prevent or cure the plague were to be happy and avoid\nbad thoughts, drink good wine, avoid eating fruit, put fragrant herbs in beverages,\navoid lechery, do not abuse the poor, eat and drink in moderation, maintain\na household in accordance with a persons status, and so on.",
        "Bathing during the plague was discouraged for two reasons. First, along with\nchanging clothes, it was a sign of vanity, which invited the wrath of God and\nthe punishment of sin. Second, bathing was believed to open the pores, making\nit easier for bad air to enter and exit the body, spreading disease. The latter\nbelief was common throughout Europe well into the the nineteenth century.",
        "Eau de Cologne and other perfumes were first used during the plague to cover\nup odors due to not bathing or changing clothing.",
        "Although the poor were hit hardest, nobility didnt escape. King Alfonso\nXI of Castile and Len was the only reigning monarch to die, but many\nmembers of royal families from Naples to England were killed.",
        "Bodies were piled up inside and outside city walls where they lay until mass\ngraves could be dug. This contributed to the bad air and helped to spread the\ndisease.",
        "Closed communities, such as monasteries and nunneries, were especially vulnerable.\nIf one person became infected, the whole community might die. And because friars\nand nuns tended the sick, infection among them was common.",
        "Gherardo, brother of the famous humanist Petrarch and a monk in the monastery\nof Montriuex, was the only survivor of the plague in his monastery, along with\nhis dog. He buried the other 34 monks himself.",
        "Of 140 Dominican brothers in Montpellier, only seven survived.",
        "English soldiers carried the disease from France to England, beginning an\nespecially devastating round of plague in England that some estimates claim\nkilled as much as 75% of the population in many areas.",
        "Prior to the Black Death, music was plentiful and cheerful. During the plague,\nmusic was rare and grim. Other art forms, including visual arts and literature,\nalso reflect the misery of the time.",
        "As the population dwindled and society crumbled, old rules were ignored.\nThe Catholic church lost influence, creating the seeds that led to Protestantism.",
        "The attempts to find cures for the plague started the momentum toward development\nof the scientific method and the changes in thinking that led to the Renaissance.",
        "After the Black Death, plague epidemics continued to ravage Europe. For example,\nLondon was struck by the Great Plague of 1665, with thousands of deaths. This\nplague was followed almost immediately by the Great Fire, leaving London devastated.",
        "A third pandemic began in China and India in the 1890s and eventually reached\nthe United States, with infections being especially dangerous in the San Francisco\nBay Area. It was during this pandemic that the real cause (Y. pestis) was\ndiscovered, along with a cure.",
        "Plague continues to survive in the modern world, with Y. pestis foci\nin Asia, Russia, the American Southwest, and other areas where the host rodents\nand fleas live. Today, though, it is rarely fatal."

According to one account, the government standard of performance for such women was to service at least 29 men a day.

        "One half to three quarters of Earths mass is made up of matter\nthat would have made separate planets if not for Earths cannibalism.",
        "Earth is called a terrestrial planet because it is made almost entirely\nof rock and metal. Because Earth formed inside the snow linemeaning\nit was close enough to the sun that water, carbon, and nitrogen were all\nin a gaseous statethe elements so essential to supporting life had\nto be supplied in some other way. They were carried to the Earth by dirty\nsnowballsasteroids that retained water in hydrated minerals. Later\nthose hydrated minerals were heated and the trapped water was released.",
        "The Earth had the energy to release trapped water from the energy supplied\nby the collisions that had delivered the minerals in the first place.",
        "The birth of Earths moon is singularly important because it stabilizes\nEarths tilt. Without the moon, Earth would still have wild changes\nin climate and be uninhabitable. The stabilizing tug of the moon tempers\nEarth, resulting in the minor tip that causes summer and winter seasons.",
        "To put the size of each of these bodies in perspective, think of the\nEarths moon as a tennis ball and Earth as the size as a basketball.\nThe suns diameter is about 109 times greater than Earths,\nwhereas Earth is just about four times larger in diameter than the moon.",
        "The great impacts that gave Earth its mass had the potential to blow\naway the fragile atmosphere that was forming and turn the oceans into steam.\nDespite these threats, Earth went through a normal birthing process for\na habitable planet.",
        "Had Earth formed in a more gentle way, the result would have been a cold\nand dead planet, because the energy of the falling bodies would have been\nsmall enough that the bodies would bounce back into space.",
        "Because Earth was hit by huge, hurtling chunks of rock and ice, they\ncratered so deeply into the interior of the planet that their heat, water,\nand future atmospheric gases were anchored there and retained by gravity.\nEarths ocean of magma was created by bodies crashing into the planet\na bit later in its development.",
        "Within 10 million years of Earths birth, its average interior\ntemperature was hot enough to melt virtually the entire planet, which caused\nthe core to sink to the middle of the planet and left the mantle a bubbling,\nviscous layer.",
        "The great heat of Earths core and magma ensured that Earth would\nhave an atmosphere and oceans. It also created plate tectonics, which meant\nits oceans would be partitioned by dry land. Heat and pressure began creating\nrock lighter than the ocean floor that would eventually emerge as floating\ncontinents.",
        "Earths unique mix of land and ocean makes the Earth relatively\nstable by cycling carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide cycling moderates temperature\nswings that would otherwise occur.",
        "Earths greatest source of heat, besides the sun, is its interior,\nwhich conducts a hundred billion billion calories of energy to the surface\neach yearor 1.5 microcalories per .155 square inch of the earths\nsurface each second. So much energy radiates from inside the Earth that\nit could satisfy all human energy needs three times over.",
        "As the earth cooled after it had finished growing, the lithospherethe\nhard, outermost layer between the mantle and the Earths crustcracked\nlike an eggshell and split into seven large and twelve small floating\nislands with jagged edges. These islands are the tectonic plates that\nmove continuously over the viscous mantle, rubbing, pushing, and trying\nto mount one over the other.",
        "Although Earths plates are made of solid rock, they buckle and\ntwist like slabs of warm clay when they collide.",
        "The Earths plates were divided into land masses and oceans because\nof the difference in the thickness and composition of the planets\ntwo types of crust. Continental crust, mostly composed of relatively\nlightweight granite, is about 18 to 30 miles thick. The much denser basalt\nthat makes up the oceanic crust is only 5 or 6 miles thick. Because they\nare more buoyant, the continents float higher on the mantle\nthan the ocean floors do.",
        "Earthquakes, volcanoes, and mountains are all formed by Earths\nmoving plates.",
        "Other planets and moons in our solar system have volcanoes, but\nthey do not have mountain ranges like Earths because only\nEarth has plate tectonics.",
        "Plate tectonics contributed to making Earth habitable by creating\nvolcanoes as well. The water vapor and other gases emitted by volcanoes\nduring Earths early years helped to create Earths oceans\nand atmosphere.",
        "When a tectonic plate lingers over a hot spot for a while and then\nmoves on, a volcanic island is formed.",
        "A hot spot is a column of basalt that punctures the earths\ncrust and allows magma to escape from the interior. The movement of\na tectonic plate over a hot spot forms a chain of volcanic islands,\ncalled a seamount. One well known example of a seamount is a chain\nof ancient volcanoes that were once over the hot spot that is now under\nHawaii.",
        "The Himalayas are examples of the movement of tectonic plates against\neach other."

      "Venus": [
        "Venus is often called Earths twin because it is the closest planet\nin size to Earth. Scientists estimate the diameter of Venus at about 7,520\nmiles, making it approximately 400 miles smaller in diameter than Earth.",
        "Although it is called Earths twin, the surface conditions of Venus\nare very different from those on Earth. Scientists believe the planets\nsurface is very hot and dry and contains no liquid water, due to extremely\nhigh surface temperatures.",
        "Ancient astronomers called Venus both Phosphorous and Hesperus, mistakenly\nbelieving that the object visible in the morning and evening were two separate\ncelestial bodies. The planet was later named Venus after the Roman goddess\nof beauty and love.",
        "Venus travels around the sun in a nearly circular orbit, with its average\ndistance from the sun varying only slightly throughout the orbit. It takes\nthe planet approximately 225 Earth days to travel completely around the sun,\ncompared to Earths 365 days.",
        "With its faster orbit around the sun, Venus overtakes Earth every 584 Earth\ndays, changing from an evening star (visible after sunset) to a morning star\n(visible before sunrise), and then vice versa.",
        "Venus is one of only two planets that rotates on its axis clockwise from\neast to west. The only other planet to do so is Uranus.",
        "Because Venus rotates very slowly on its axis (taking 243 days to make\na complete rotation), a day on Venus is longer than its year.",
        "When seen from Earth, Venus is brighter than any other planet or any star\nin the sky. At certain times of the year, it is the first planet or star\nvisible in the western sky at nightand at other times, it is the last\nplanet or star visible in the morning.",
        "Venus is constantly covered by thick clouds of sulfuric acid, through which\nno visible light can penetrate. For this reason, astronomers have been unable\nto view the planets features through optical telescopes. Most of the\nknowledge about Venus surface has been gained through radar images\nacquired from U.S. and Soviet space probes.",
        "Approximately 65% of Venus surface is covered in flat, smooth plains,\nand the remaining 35% is made up of six mountainous regions. The mountain\nrange Maxwell, which is about seven miles high and 540 miles long, is the\nhighest feature on the planet.",
        "Venus has far fewer impact craters (created when a planet and an asteroid\ncollide) on its surface than Mercury, Mars, and Earths moon, leading geologists\nto believe that the current surface of the planet is less than one billion\nyears old.",
        "The atmosphere of Venus is heavier than the atmosphere of any other planet.\nIt is made up primarily of carbon dioxide and exerts an estimated 1,323 pounds\nper square inch (psi) of pressure on the planet, roughly 90 times more pressure\nthan Earths atmosphere.",
        "Venus high surface temperature is a result of the greenhouse effect.\nBecause of the large clouds of sulfuric acid surrounding the planet and its\nthick atmosphere of carbon dioxide, nearly all of the radiant energy from\nthe sun that enters the atmosphere is trapped and held at the planets\nsurface.",
        "The force of gravity on Venus is slightly less than gravity on Earth. A\nperson weighing 100 pounds on Earth would weigh approximately 88 pounds on\nVenus.",
        "Due to its slightly smaller size and its lower density, Venus mass is\nabout 80% that of Earth.",
        "Venus was first observed from space on December 14, 1962, when an unmanned\nU.S. spacecraft called Mariner 2 passed within 21,600 miles of the planet\nafter traveling through space for 3 months. It was the first of all\nthe planets (with the exception of Earth) to be seen from space.",
        "The first spacecraft to successfully land on Venus was the Soviet spaceship\nVenera 7, which reached the planets surface on December 15, 1970.\nSeveral spacecraft had gone near the surface prior to this date, and the\nSoviet Venera 3 had crashed into the planet in 1966.",
        "Until quite recently, Venus had been visited by more space probes than\nany other planet (Mars has now been visited more), with 18 Soviet and six\nAmerican spacecraft making the trip.",
        "Venus is currently being explored by the Venus Express spacecraft launched\nby the European Space Agency in November of 2005. The mission has been extended\nseveral times and is planned to remain on Venus until December of 2012.",
        "The average temperature on Venus surface is about 870 Fahrenheit,\nmaking it the hottest planet in the solar system and hotter than most ovens.",
        "While astronomers are unsure whether any form of life exists on Venus,\nit is highly doubted. Due to the incredibly hot temperatures on the planets\nsurface, none of the plants or animals that live on Earth could survive on\nVenus.",
        "Venus is the second planet from the sun and the closest planet to Earth.\nThe distance between Venus and Earth varies from 23.7 million miles when\nthe planets are closest together to 162 million miles when they are farthest\napart.",
        "Geologists believe that Venus once had large bodies of water on its surface,\nsimilar to those on Earth, which dried up approximately 300 million years\nago as the sun began emitting greater amounts of solar energy.",
        "Because Venus is only slightly tilted on its axis, it has no real seasonal\nvariation in temperature as does Earthit is simply baking all the\ntime.",
        "Scientists believe Venus was formed largely by volcanic processes, due\nto the large amount of volcanoes, lava flows, craters, and ridges which make\nup the planets surface.",
        "In 2007, images and data from the Venus Express spacecraft were able to\nconfirm that lightning occurs on Venus and that the phenomenon is more common\nthere than on Earth.",
        "Prior to the 1970s, there was vast speculation among astronomers about\nthe nature of Venus surface. Many scientists believed the planet would\nbe quite tropical, and the first Soviet spacecraft sent to the planet was\nloaded with equipment to confirm the presence of water.",
        "Unlike other planets, Venus has no craters on its surface smaller than\n1.25 miles across. Because the atmosphere is so dense, smaller asteroids\nare crushed to powder before they reach the surface of the planet, leaving\nno smaller craters.",
        "Because Venus is so much brighter in the sky than anything except the sun and Earths moon, it drew notice from many ancient civilizations. The Chinese\ncalled it Tai-pe or the beautiful white one, the Egyptians\ncalled it Bonou for bird, and the Chaldeans named\nit the bright torch of heaven.",
        "The English word Friday is derived from the Anglo-Saxon Frigedaeg,\nmeaning Venus day (Friga = Venus + dae =\nday), and many other languages also trace their names for Friday from root\nwords meaning Venus day.",
        "Several ancient civilizations practiced Venus worship in some form or another,\nand surprisingly veneration of the planet has persisted until modern times.\nIt has been suggested that human sacrifices were offered to the planet as\nlate as the nineteenth century by Polynesian cultures and the Skidi Pawnee\nIndians in North America.",
        "Because the large masses of clouds never clear from Venus skies,\nneither Earth nor the sun is ever visible from the planets surface.",
        "Venus experiences a constant, high-speed wind that carries its clouds on\na complete trip around the planet every four Earth days.",
        "While the equatorial diameter of Earth is 27 miles greater than its diameter\nmeasured from pole to pole, the two diameters for Venus are virtually the\nsame, making the planet an almost perfect sphere.",
        "There is no detectable magnetic field on Venus (like that found on Earth),\nleading scientists to believe that the liquid core of the planet is likely\nmuch smaller than Earths.",
        "Venus and Mercury are the only two planets in the solar system that do\nnot have any moons orbiting around them.",
        "Venus, the brightest of all the planets, can be so bright that on a moonless\nnight, the planet can actually cast shadows on Earth.",
        "Due to its proximity to the sun, Venus, like Earth, has a limited timespan.\nAs the sun swells to become a red giant star in a few thousand million years,\nits luminosity will increase to such a point as to surely destroy the inner\nplanets (Mercury, Venus, and Earth)."

        "Discovered in 1789 by William Herschel, Saturns moon Enceladus (named\nafter the mythological giant) has geysers that erupt icy particles, water\nvapor, and organic compounds. It is the shiniest object in the solar system\nbecause its icy surface reflects most of the light it receives.",
        "The geysers on Enceladus not only feed the rings around Saturn but also\nmay contain ingredients for life. Only two other outer solar\nsystem objects have known active eruptions: Neptunes moon Triton and\nJupiters moon Io, which are believed to erupt nitrogen and sulfur,\nrespectively.",
        "Saturns largest moon, Titan, is the only known moon to have a substantial\natmosphere, which is 370 miles deep, 10 times thicker than Earths\natmosphere. Conditions on Titan may resemble ancient Earth conditions, though\nat a much lower temperature.",

        "The average temperature of Saturn is -178 C. While there are some temperature differences between poles and the equator, most of the differences occur horizontally. This is because Saturns heat (which can reach up to 11,700 C near the core) does not come from the Sun, but from its interior.",
